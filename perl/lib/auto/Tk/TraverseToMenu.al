# tkTraverseToMenu --
# This procedure implements keyboard traversal of menus. Given an
# ASCII character "char", it looks for a menubutton with that character
# underlined. If one is found, it posts the menubutton's menu
#
# Arguments:
# w - Window in which the key was typed (selects
# a toplevel window).
# char - Character that selects a menu. The case
# is ignored. If an empty string, nothing
# happens.
