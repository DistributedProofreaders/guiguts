# focusNext --
# This procedure is invoked to move the input focus to the next window
# after a given one. "Next" is defined in terms of the window
# stacking order, with all the windows underneath a given top-level
# (no matter how deeply nested in the hierarchy) considered except
# for frames and toplevels.
#
# Arguments:
# w - Name of a window: the procedure will set the focus
# to the next window after this one in the traversal
# order.
