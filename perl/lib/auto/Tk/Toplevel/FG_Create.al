#			Focus Group
#
# Focus groups are used to handle the user's focusing actions inside a
# toplevel.
#
# One example of using focus groups is: when the user focuses on an
# entry, the text in the entry is highlighted and the cursor is put to
# the end of the text. When the user changes focus to another widget,
# the text in the previously focused entry is validated.
#

#----------------------------------------------------------------------
# tkFocusGroup_Create --
#
#	Create a focus group. All the widgets in a focus group must be
#	within the same focus toplevel. Each toplevel can have only
#	one focus group, which is identified by the name of the
#	toplevel widget.
