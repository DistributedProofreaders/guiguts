# CHARACTER CONVERSION, for conversion of Latin-1 characters to ASCII:
# - display indicates how to convert characters for display purposes, such as
#   chapter anchors.  Characters that are replaced by a single character can
#   be left out, and will then be converted using the default one-character
#   conversion.
# - sort indicates how characters are converted in alphabetisation.  For
#   example, Swedish would place ä at the end of the alphabet, while German
#   and languages that don't use ä natively, would usually treat is as a.
# FORMAT: Each character is immediately followed by the string that should
# replace it.
