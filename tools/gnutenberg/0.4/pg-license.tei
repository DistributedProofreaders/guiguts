          Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this

          to protect the &pgtm; concept and trademark. &pg; is a registered

          anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the rules is
          very easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as
          creation of derivative works, reports, performances and research.
          They may be modified and printed and given away &mdash; you may do
          practically <emph>anything</emph> with public domain eBooks.

                refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written

            <p>&pgtm; is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works
            in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including
            obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the
            efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks
            of life.</p>

            <p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
            assistance they need, is critical to reaching &pgtm;'s goals and
            ensuring that the &pgtm; collection will remain freely available for
            generations to come. In 2001, the &pglaf; was created to provide a
            secure and permanent future for &pgtm; and future generations. To learn
            more about the &pglaf; and how your efforts and donations can help, see

            <head type="sub">Information about Donations to the &pglaf;</head>

            <p>&pgtm; depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public
            support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number
            of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in
            machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
            including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
            particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the
            IRS.</p>

            <p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
            charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
            States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
            considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
            with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
            we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
            DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
            visit <xptr url="&pgurl;/fundraising/donate"/></p>

            <p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
            have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
            against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
            approach us with offers to donate.</p>

            <p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
            any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
            outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

            <p>Please check the &pg; Web pages for current donation methods and
            addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including
            checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please

            works.</head>

            <p><name type="person">Professor Michael S. Hart</name> is the
            originator of the &pgtm; concept of a library of electronic works that
            could be freely shared with anyone. For thirty years, he produced and
            distributed &pgtm; eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer
            support.</p>

            <p>&pgtm; eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of
            which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
            notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in
            compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

            <p>Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
            eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
            compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>

            <p>Corrected <emph>editions</emph> of our eBooks replace the old file
            and take over the old filename and etext number. The replaced older file
            is renamed. <emph>Versions</emph> based on separate sources are treated
            as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.</p>

            <p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
            facility: 
            
              <xptr rend="display" url="&pgurl;" />

            <p>This Web site includes information about &pgtm;, including how to
            make donations to the &pglaf;, how to help produce our new eBooks, and
            how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
