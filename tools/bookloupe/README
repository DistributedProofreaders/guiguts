                                   =========

General installation instructions can be found in INSTALL. The following
aim to give a quick overview and some help for specific systems. Documentation
for bookloupe itself can be found in doc/bookloupe.txt and for the test
framework in doc/loupe-test.txt.

Linux
-----

You should be able to use the standard:

% ./configure
% make
% sudo make install

If you get an error about no package 'glib-2.0' found, then you need to
install the development package for glib2. Under Fedora, RHEL and friends
that would be:

% sudo yum install gcc pkgconfig glib2-devel

Under Debian, Ubuntu and friends that would be:

% sudo apt-get install gcc pkgconfig glib2-devel

Microsoft Windows
-----------------

It should be possible to use either MSYS (http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS)
or cygwin (http://www.cygwin.com/) to build on a Windows machine. You'll
need a copy of the development package for glib and its dependencies
from http://www.gtk.org/download/win32.php.

It's much easier to build using a cross-compiler from Linux, if you have
access to such a system. Under Fedora, RHEL and friends you can do this
with:

% sudo yum install mingw32-gcc pkgconfig mingw32-glib2-static \
  mingw32-gettext-static mingw32-iconv-static
% ./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --disable-shared \
  --bindir=/bookloupe --datadir=/
% make
% mkdir build
% make install DESTDIR=`pwd`/build

The contents of the build/bookloupe directory can then be copied to a
Microsoft Windows machine.

Depending on the version of mingw32-gcc you use, you may need to specify a
different host type. If you're not sure look and see what the cross-compiler
is called (eg., i686-pc-mingw32-gcc) and use the prefix as the host type.

Mac
---

The least intrusive means to build on a Mac is to use Homebrew:

http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/

Install Homebrew according to its instructions.

If you are building bookloupe for your own use, you can use dynamic linking
like this:

$ brew install glib

and then install bookloupe using:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

If you want to build bookloupe for other people to use, you will probably
want to link staticly. To do this you need to edit the formula for glib
and each of its dependencies (gettext and libffi) using something like:

$ brew edit gettext

Each time find the args statement which includes --prefix and insert
--disable-shared,for example change:

args = ["--disable-dependency-tracking", "--disable-rebuilds",
           "--prefix=#{prefix}",
           "--disable-dtrace"]

to

args = ["--disable-dependency-tracking", "--disable-rebuilds",
           "--disable-shared",
           "--prefix=#{prefix}",
           "--disable-dtrace"]

and then

$ brew install glib

before installing bookloupe as normal, but with the extra flag to configure:

$ ./configure --disable-shared
$ make
$ make install

Note that if you have previously used dynamic linking this may not work.
(Homebrew doesn't seem to create .la files in a form that libtool can use
when it is asked to prefer static libraries to dynamic ones.) Removing the
dynamic libraries first will solve this problem.

It may also be possible to use fink or macports.
