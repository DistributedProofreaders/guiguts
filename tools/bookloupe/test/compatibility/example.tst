They saw him distinctly, as with the naked eye; a word, a turn of
the pen, or a word unsaid, offered the picture of him in America,
Japan, China, Australia , nay, the continent of Europe, holding an
English review of his Maker's grotesques. Vernon seemed a
sheepish fellow, without stature abroad, glad of a compliment
, grateful for a dinner, endeavouring sadly to digest all he saw
and heard. But one was a Patterne; tbe other a Whitford. One had
genius; the other pottered after him to he a student. One was the
English gent1eman wherever he went; the other was a new kind of
thing, nondescript, produced in England of late, and not likely
to come to much good himself, or do much good to the country.

Vernon's dancing in America was capitally described by Willoughby.
"Adieu to our cousins!" the latter wrote on his voyage to Japan.
"I may possibly have had some vogue in their ball-rooms, and in
showing them an English seat on horseback: 1 must resign myself if
I have not been popular among them. I could not sing their
national song--if a congery of states be a nation-- and I must
confess I listened with frigid politeness to their singing of it.
A great people, no doubt. Adieu to them. I have had to tear old
Vernon away. He had serious thoughts of settling, means to

correspond with some of them. On the whole, forgetting two or
more "traits of insolence~ on the part of his hosts, which he
cited, Willoughby escaped pretty comfortably. The President had
been, consciously or not,uncivil, but one knew his origin! Upon
these interjections, placable flicks of the lionly tail addressed
to Britannia the Ruler, who expected him in some mildish way to
lash terga cauda in retiring, Sir WilIoughby Patterne passed from
a land of alien manners,; and ever after he spoke of America
respectfully aud pensively, with a tail tucked in, as it were. His
travels were profitable to himself. The fact is, that tbere are
cousins who come to greatness and rnust be pacified, or they will
prove annoying. Heaven forefend a collision between cousins!
