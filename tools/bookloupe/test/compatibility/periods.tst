"Say, it took more than two minutes to deliver that book," remarked Dick
. "We were just getting ready to go on without you."

Common abbreviations shouldn't be warned about. Mr. and Mrs. are used for
individuals, as is Dr. and Mssrs. is used for a number of people. MSS. is
an abbreviation of manuscripts, whereas st. and lb. (and its plural lbs.)
are weights and ft. is for feet.

In more scholarly work, we have pp. for pages, cf. for confer (compare),
vs. for verses, vol. for volume (and its plural vols.), ed. for edition,
viz. for videlicet (that is), op. cit. for opus citatum est (already
cited), and chap. for chapter.

In mathematics, we come across deg. for degrees and min. for minutes. When
we turn to business, we might meet ltd. for limited and cent. and its
plural cents. for centum (hundred).

In more general usage, we have pm. for post meridiem (afternoon) and etc.
for et cetera (and others).

If we coin our own abbreviatn. then we should be warned about it exactly
once, no matter how many times that abbreviatn. is used.

Acronyms like M.P. shouldn't generate any warnings, unless we get confused
and write M .P. by mistake.
