**************** INPUT ****************
While there are a number of very important cases where two (or more)
punctuation marks can be adjacent,, there are a number of double
punctuation cases that can never be correct,.

Further insight into the fall migration of the chimney swift is
provided by the consideration of a few of the several hundred banding
records that have been accumulated. One banded at Lexington,
Mo., on September 23 was recaptured at Baton Rouge, La., on September
27; one banded at Newark, Ohio, on September 20 was retaken
at Nashville, Tenn., on September 27; while a third, banded on
August 23 at Kents Island, New Brunswick, was retrapped at Opelika,
Ala., on September 20. A swift banded at 5:30 on the morning of September
22 at Glasgow, Ky., was taken that same evening in a chimney
at Nashville, Tenn., 90 miles from the point of banding. Another
record, which seems to indicate the direction of the movement along
the Gulf coast, is of a bird banded at Sanford, Fla., on August 9 and
found with a broken wing near Tallulah, La., on September 25.
