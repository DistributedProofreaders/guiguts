## Packaging

We include pre-built binaries for Windows and MacOS. For other platforms we
ship the files necessary to build Jeebies.

## Building

Building Jeebies is very simple, as it only has the single `jeebies.c` source
file. A `Makefile` is included to make this brainless, however:

```
make build
```
