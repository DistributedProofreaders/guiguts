# DP Sans Mono

[DP Sans Mono](https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/DP_Sans_Mono) is a custom proofreading
font designed to distinguish between similar-looking characters and exaggerates
differences in punctuation and diacriticals. It is the spiritual successor to
DPCustomMono2. Unlike DPCustomMono2, DP Sans Mono has much broader Unicode
character support.
