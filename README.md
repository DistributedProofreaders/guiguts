## Download

Note: old binaries are still available from the
[Guiguts project at Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/guiguts/files/guiguts/).

### Window

`guiguts-win-1.0.nn.zip` is the easiest download for Windows users. It includes
guiguts.pl and supporting files and helper applications, excluding image
viewer and spellchecker. It should work out of the box by running
run_guiguts.bat (it includes copies of perl and Python languages).

### Mac

`guiguts-mac-1.0.nn.zip` (if available) should work out of the box for
Mac users; it includes a few helper applications. If not available for
a recent version, you're probably better off with the generic download.

### Other

`guiguts-1.0.nn.zip` is the basic guiguts version with a few helper
applications; it includes compilable source code for GutCheck and
Jeebies. See https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/Guiguts/Install for details
on further helper applications.
