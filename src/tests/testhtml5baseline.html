<p class="center">PREFACE.
</p>


<p>In presenting to the public another volume of my
detective stories, I would call the attention of the reader
to the fact, that these stories are literally written from
facts and incidents which have come under my own
observation, or been worked up by officers acting directly
under my instructions.</p>

<p>The Mississippi River has for many years&mdash;more
especially since the close of the war&mdash;been infested by
a class of men who never would try to get an honest
living, but would prey upon their neighbors or attack
the property of southern railroads and express companies;
these marauders could be seen any day prowling
along the banks of the Mississippi, in fact, the shores
and immediate neighborhood were peopled by just such
a class, who cared not how they obtained a living; for
the crimes they committed, they often suffered infinitely
worse punishment, more so than any suffering which
could have been entailed on them from leading a poor
but honest life.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>The story of the "<span class="smcap">Mississippi Outlaws and the
Detectives</span>" is written to illustrate incidents which
took place in the southern section of the country at no
very remote date.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Don Pedro and the Detectives</span>" is another story
of detective experience, which came under my own
observation and management; it is a truthful narrative,
and shows that some men are worse than known criminals,
and can squander the money they have obtained
by false pretenses, in a very lavish manner.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">The Poisoner and the Detectives</span>" is a well-known
bit of detective experience, which, when read,
will be recognized by any one who ever takes an interest
in crime, and the bringing to justice its perpetrators.</p>

<p>The reader must remember that fictitious names are
used in all of these stories, otherwise the facts are
plainly and truthfully told as they occurred.</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER I.
</p>

<blockquote><p><i>A daring Express Robbery.&mdash;Mr. Pinkerton appealed
to.&mdash;Cane-brakes and cane-fed People.&mdash;Annoying
Delays and Amateur Detectives.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>The southern and border states, since the close
of the war of the rebellion, have been the
frequent scenes of extensive and audacious robberies.
This has been largely owing to the
sparsely-settled condition of certain districts, to
the disorder and lawlessness generated by the
war, and to the temptations offered by the carelessness
of many persons having large sums intrusted
to their care in transit through lonely and
desolate localities.</p>

<p>The express companies have always been favorite
objects of attack by thieves of every grade,
from the embezzling cashier to the petty sneak-thief,
and some of the operations connected with
the detection of this class of criminals are among
the most difficult and dangerous that have ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
been intrusted to me. Probably a no more reckless
and desperate body of men were ever banded
together in a civilized community than those who
were brought to my attention in 1871 by the
Southern Express Company's officers in Memphis;
and I consider the successful termination of my
efforts in this case as of the greatest value to the
people of the South and West. The whole affair
was conducted with such a limited force, and
under such adverse circumstances, that I take
pride in here recording the history of the affair
and my connection with it. Though I maintained
a general supervision of the operation, my eldest
son, William A. Pinkerton, was the person having
immediate charge of the matter, and to his
energy, perseverance, and sagacity is mainly attributable
our success.</p>

<p>Some time in the latter part of July, 1871, an
express messenger on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad
was overpowered by three men at Moscow,
Kentucky, and his safe was robbed of about sixteen
hundred dollars. The manner of effecting
the robbery was a very bold one, showing the
presence of men of experience in crime. The loss
was not heavy, but the company made every effort
to discover the robbers, in the hope of bringing
them to a severe punishment as a warning to
other criminals. In spite, however, of the efforts
of two of my men, who were immediately sent to
the scene of the robbery, the guilty parties escaped
into the almost impenetrable swamps along
the Mississippi River, and the chase was reluct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>antly
abandoned, as it was impossible to tell where
they would come out or cross the river. The
amount stolen was not sufficiently large to warrant
the expenditure of much time or money in
the pursuit of the thieves, and my men were soon
wholly withdrawn from the operation. In order,
however, to guard against a repetition of such a
raid, an extra man was placed in each express car
to act as guard to the regular messenger. It was
considered that two men, well armed, ought to be
surely able to protect the company against further
loss, and everything ran smoothly until October 21,
1871. At this time, the money shipments by express
were very heavy, as a rule, and orders were
given that special care should be exercised by all
the employés having money packages in charge.</p>

<p>The northern-bound train on the Mobile and
Ohio Railroad was due at Union City, Tennessee,
about half-past seven o'clock in the evening. At
this point the northern and southern-bound trains
usually passed each other, and stopped long
enough for supper, the train arriving first being
the one to take the side track ready to pull out.
Saturday evening, October 21st, the northern-bound
train arrived on time, stopped at the
station long enough to let the passengers go to
supper, and then took the side track to await the
arrival of the train bound south. As soon as the
side track was reached the conductor, engineer,
fireman, brakeman, and express messenger went
to supper, leaving the train deserted except by
the express guard, named George Thompson, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
a few passengers. The local express agent came
up at this moment, gave his packages to Thompson,
receiving his receipt therefor, and returned
to the station. This action was directly contrary
to the rules of the company, which forbade the
messenger to leave the car during his whole run,
or to go to sleep; also, the guard was forbidden to
transact any business, or to have possession of
the safe key. Martin Crowley, the messenger,
had given his key to Thompson, however, to
enable him to attend to the business of the local
agent while Crowley was away at supper. In
accordance with Thompson's request, Crowley
sent a negro porter to the express car with
Thompson's supper on a tray, and the porter,
after handing the tray to Thompson, turned to
walk away. As he did so, he saw two men spring
into the partly open door of the express car, and,
almost immediately, the train began to back.
The negro knew that something was wrong, and
he hurried to the station to give the alarm. By
the time he arrived there, however, the train was
backing at a moderate speed, and was well beyond
the reach of pursuit on foot.</p>

<p>Meantime, the guard, having received his supper
from the negro porter, turned his back to the
door to set the tray down. Before reaching the
desk, he heard a noise at the door, and turning,
he was confronted by two men, one of whom held
a revolver at his head, while the other seized his
throat. Thompson was a young man, and, not
being accustomed to meet such hard characters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
he was badly frightened. He immediately gave
up the safe key and helped one of the men to unlock
the safe. Having taken all the money out
of the safe, one of the robbers took also the contents
of Thompson's pocket-book; but here the
other man interfered, insisting that the guard's
money be returned to him, which was done. No
conversation took place, but when the safe had
been carefully examined and all the money it contained
taken, one of the men stepped to the door
and swung a lantern once or twice. The train,
which had been backing at a moderate rate of
speed, now stopped, and the two men jumped off,
telling Thompson to stay where he was and keep
quiet. When the conductor, engineer, and other
persons, whom the porter had alarmed, reached
the train, they found everything in order except
the safe, into which poor Thompson was vainly
peering in the hope of discovering that some portion
of the funds might have been overlooked.
The men had disappeared in the thick woods, and
no trace of them was found except a small carpet-bag
containing potatoes and bread. The
amount missing from the safe was about six
thousand dollars in currency.</p>

<p>Although the robbery was at once reported to Mr.
M. J. O'Brien, the General Superintendent, by telegraph,
no action seems to have been taken until
the following Wednesday&mdash;four days later&mdash;when
Mr. O'Brien sent me a brief telegram announcing
the robbery, and requesting me to come to Union
City in person, if possible, and if not, to send my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
eldest son, William A. Pinkerton. The telegraph
was used freely for the next two days, and while
my son was gathering clues and making his preparations,
we learned most of the facts by letter.
William arrived in Union City on Saturday, just
one week after the robbery had been committed,
and he instantly began to gather information from
every available source. Except the statements of
the negro porter and Thompson, the guard, as
condensed in the account heretofore given, little
information could be obtained, as so few persons
were about the train when it began to move off.
While two or three had seen the men who had
entered the car, no one had seen who had run
the locomotive, and there was, therefore, no certainty
as to the number of persons engaged in
the job. One passenger had seen two men walking
toward the engine in a suspicious manner,
and, as his description of these two was entirely
different from that given of the men who had
entered the car, it was fair to presume that they
had been a part of the gang. Still, no one had
seen them get on the engine, and it was not certain
that they had had anything to do with the
affair. At the end of three days, however, William
had collected sufficient information to satisfy
himself that either four or five men had been
at work together; and, by collating the various
descriptions he received, he obtained a pretty fair
idea of the party.</p>

<p>The first thing which struck him was the similarity
of this robbery to the one which had occurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
exactly three months before at Moscow, Kentucky.
The appearance of the men and their actions had
been precisely like those of the Moscow party, and
it was evident that they had been emboldened to a
second venture by the ease with which they had
carried through their former scheme. One thing
was imperative: the capture of the whole gang
would be necessary to insure the safety of the express
company's property in the future. Indeed,
it was a mere piece of good fortune that the loss
in this instance was not irreparable, for the
amount of money carried on the southern-bound
train was eighty thousand dollars, and the robbers
would have obtained this large amount if the
southern-bound train had chanced to arrive first.
The robbery was clearly one which no common
tramp or sneak-thief would have dared to attempt,
and William saw immediately the difficulties of
his work. Before proceeding with the incidents
of the operation, I must give some idea of the
country and the people living there, since no-one
would otherwise comprehend one-half of the obstacles
and dangers which were involved in a
search for the criminals in that vicinity.</p>

<p>The southwestern part of Kentucky and the
northwestern part of Tennessee are about as desolate
portions of the world as are inhabited by a
civilized people. There seems to have been some
convulsion of the earth at this point, which is
sunk so far below the general level of the whole
country as to make it a perpetual swamp. The
annual overflow of the Ohio and Mississippi lays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the country under water for a distance of many
miles, while even in the dryest season, the morasses,
sunken lakes, and dense cane-brakes, render
it almost impassable, except for people who
have been thoroughly acquainted with the locality
for years.</p>

<p>The sunken lakes are natural curiosities in themselves,
and, although they have attracted considerable
attention from scientific men, no satisfactory
explanation of their causes and phenomena
has been found. The country is full of game and
the water is alive with fish, so that the necessities
of life are easily obtainable. The cane-brakes are
wonderful growths of bamboo cane, and they
sometimes cover strips of country as much as
seventy miles long. In the spring-time, the water
rises to such a height that a skiff can navigate
freely above and through the tops of the cane;
but in dry weather, the stalks grow so closely together
that the brake becomes impenetrable to
man or beast, except by winding tortuously
around the clumps through the comparatively
thin portions of the undergrowth. To search for
any one wishing to remain concealed therein is
like the proverbial attempt to look for a needle in
a hay-stack, since a man can pass within ten
yards of another without seeing him or being
aware of his presence. The only roads which
traverse these places are mere cattle paths, which
begin at no place and run nowhere; and, unless a
man be thoroughly acquainted with the country,
he can never tell where any given path will lead
him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>The people around the towns, such as Hickman,
Union City, Dyersburg, and Moscow, are a highly
respectable and well-educated class; but in the
low, swampy country, in the cane brake and along
the river, they are not, as a rule, a very agreeable
class to live among. Of course, here, as in all
other places, there are many intelligent, reliable,
honorable men, but the great mass of the cane-brake
population are ignorant and brutal. The
term which they apply to their stock is also eminently
appropriate to designate the people: they
are "cane-fed." It is the custom to turn the cattle
into the cane to feed when it is young and
tender, and, as the amount of nutriment thus
obtained is not very large, the "cane-fed" animals
bear about the same relation to grain-fed stock
that the people in that vicinity bear to the residents
of healthy, prosperous, and educated communities.
The larger portion of the population may be classed
as "poor whites," and they constitute a peculiar
variety of the human species. The men are tall,
loose-jointed, and dyspeptic; they bear a marked
resemblance to the vegetable productions of the
vicinity, being rapid of growth, prolific, and generally
worthless. Their education consists mainly
of woodcraft and rifle-shooting; their proficiency
in both of these branches is sometimes astonishing,
and it is frequently said of their most expert
hunters that they seem to have been born
shot-gun or rifle in hand. Accomplishments they
have none, except the rare instances where a few
tunes upon the banjo have been learned from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
negroes. Their tastes are few and simple,&mdash;whisky,
snuff, hog, and hominy being the necessities and
luxuries of life; that is, whisky and snuff are the
necessities, all other things being secondary considerations.
In their sober moods, they are frank,
rough, and courageous; yet, even then, there is
little about them to excite other feelings than
those of pity and aversion. When full of bad
whisky, however, they are apt to become quarrelsome
and brutal, so that no man can feel sure
of his safety in their company. An affront, real
or imaginary, will then be apt to cause bloodshed,
even if the insulted party has to bushwhack his
enemy from a secure covert on the roadside as he
is returning to his home. Every man goes armed,
and, though fair fights in broad daylight are rare,
cold-blooded murders are not infrequent. The
law is seldom invoked to settle private differences,
and, in fact, the functions of the legal officials are
practically very limited in their influence. If a
coroner ever sits upon a corpse, it is understood
that he has done his whole duty by recording a
verdict that "the deceased came to his death at
the hands of some person or persons unknown."</p>

<p>The women, like the men, are tall, thin, and
round-shouldered. Up to the age of sixteen they
sometimes are quite pretty, though sallow and
lifeless always; after that period, they become
gaunt, emaciated, and yellow. Whisky hath
charms for them, also, but their favorite dissipation
is snuff-dipping. They marry very early and
bear children nearly every year, so that the size<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
of many of these West Tennessee families is often
enormous. The father exercises patriarchal control
over his whole household until the daughters
are married and the sons old enough and strong
enough to defy the parental authority as enforced
by a hickory rod. The wife never escapes the application
of this potent instrument of marital discipline;
and, indeed, should a husband fail to
make frequent use of it for the correction of his
better half, he would probably soon learn that his
dutiful spouse could find a use for it on his own
person.</p>

<p>Throughout this whole district, the people suffer
from fever and ague for nine months of the
year, and dyspepsia seems hereditary. Their physicians,
however, usually require no further education
than is requisite to attend fractured limbs
and gun-shot wounds, the whole school of medicine
being limited to three specifics: quinine,
calomel, and whisky.</p>

<p>As before stated, it should be understood that
the foregoing description applies to the majority
of the inhabitants of the low swamp lands only,
and not to the residents in and about the towns;
even in the cane country itself are to be found occasionally
men of education, ability, and good
character, and to several of them William was
largely indebted for assistance and information.</p>

<p>There was one redeeming feature also to the
character of the "cane-fed" population; in the
main they were honest, and they would do all in
their power to break up a thieving gang, even if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
they had to hang a few of its members as a warning
to the rest. I was thus able to trust them to
a certain extent, though the fear which they had
of this band of desperadoes rather kept their
naturally honest impulses in check for a time.</p>

<p>William was thoroughly acquainted with the
character of the people, and he knew what a
difficult task had been set before him, especially
as he was allowed no other detectives of my force
to assist him, the express company being desirous
of conducting the operation as economically
as possible. Among the large number of men
employed directly by the company were two or
three good men, but the majority were even
worse than useless, and the expense of the affair
was finally much greater than as if only my own
men had been employed. Besides the fact that
William was thus continually working with
strange men, he was harassed by large numbers
of amateur detectives, to whose stories the company's
officers too often lent a ready ear. Indeed,
every express agent in Tennessee, Kentucky, and
Missouri seemed impressed with the idea that he
was a naturally gifted detective, and many were
the annoying delays which resulted from their
interference.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>




<p class="center">CHAPTER II.
</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Difficulties.&mdash;Blind Trails and False Scents.&mdash;A Series
of Illustrations showing the Number of Officious
People and Confidence Men that often seek Notoriety
and Profit through important Detective Operations.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>The art of detecting crime cannot be learned
in a day, nor can the man of business understand,
without previous experience in the habits
of criminals, the expedients which the boldest
class of law-breakers adopt; hence none but skilled
detectives can hope to cope with them. Yet often
my clients insist on some certain method of procedure
wholly contrary to my judgment and experience,
until the total failure of their plan
convinces them that there can be but one
thoroughly successful mode of detection, namely,
to submit the case to a skilled detective of character
and standing, and allow him to act according
to his judgment.</p>

<p>The range of investigation in such a case as this
robbery will often extend from New York to San
Francisco, and unless one mind gathers up the
clues, classifies the information, and determines
the general plan, there will be continual error and
delay. Such a state of affairs frequently occurred
during this operation, and much time and money
were spent upon matters too trifling even for consideration.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>The principal of a detective agency, from his
long experience with criminals, learns the earmarks
of different classes of men, and he is often
able to determine the name of the guilty party in
any given robbery by the manner in which the job
was done. He can readily see whether a novice
in crime was engaged, and also whether any collusion
existed between the parties robbed and the
criminals; and so, when he sees the traces of a
bold, skillful, and experienced man, he knows that
it is useless to track down some insignificant
sneak-thief, simply because the latter happens to
have been in the vicinity. Yet, neither will he
slight the smallest clue if there is a bare chance
that any valuable fact may be obtained from it.
But the <i>sine qua non</i> is that he, and he alone,
shall direct the whole affair. A divided responsibility
simply doubles the criminal's opportunities
for escape.</p>

<p>Among the many difficulties of the detective's
work, none are more embarrassing than the early
development of false clues. In the stories heretofore
published, the direct steps leading to the
detection and arrest of the criminals have been
related, without referring to the innumerable
other investigations, which were progressing simultaneously,
and which, though involving the
expenditure of much thought, time, and money,
proved after all to be of no value whatever in
developing any evidence in the case. In this
operation, such instances were of frequent occurrence,
and I propose to mention a few of them to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
show how wide is the range of the detective's
inquiries, and also the annoying delays to which
he is often subjected by the inconsiderate zeal
and interference of outside parties. These latter
may be&mdash;indeed, they generally are&mdash;well meaning
people, anxious to serve the cause of justice;
though, on the other hand, they are sometimes
spiteful meddlers, striving to fix suspicion upon
some personal enemy.</p>

<p>The plan of detection which alone can insure
success, must be one which neither forgets nor
neglects anything. In investigating any alleged
crime, the first questions to be considered are:
1. Has any crime been perpetrated, and, if so,
what? 2. What was the object sought thereby?</p>

<p>The matter of time, place, and means employed
must then be carefully noted, and finally we come
to consider: 1. Who are the criminals? 2. Where
are they now? 3. How can they be taken?</p>

<p>The fact that a crime has been committed is
generally apparent, though there have been
cases in which the determination of that point requires
as much skill as the whole remainder of
the operation. Such was the case in the detection
of Mrs. Pattmore's murder, related in my
story of "The Murderer and the Fortune Teller."
The object of a crime is also sometimes obscure,
and, where such are the circumstances, the detection
of the criminal is apt to be one of the most
difficult of all operations. Having once solved
these two difficulties satisfactorily, however, and
having observed the relative bearings of time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
place, and means to the crime itself, the question
of individuals is the important one to be determined.
It often happens that there is no concealment
of identity, the problem to be solved being
simply the way to catch the guilty parties; but,
on the other hand, the greatest skill, experience,
patience, and perseverance are sometimes required
to discover, first of all, the persons engaged in the
crime. Indeed, an operation is often divisible
into two distinct methods of action, the first being
to find out the identity of the criminals, the second
to follow up and capture them.</p>

<p>In the course of a blind trail, such as we were
obliged to travel in the case of this express robbery,
it was impossible to know whence the men
had come or whither they had gone; hence, I
was forced to take up every trifling clue and follow
it to the end. Even after I was satisfied in
my own mind of the identity of the criminals, the
agents and officers of the express company were
continually finding mares' nests which they
wished investigated, and the operation was sometimes
greatly hindered on this account. As an
example of the number of discouragements which
the detective must always expect to encounter, I
propose to mention some of the false scents which
we were forced to follow during this operation.</p>

<p>Three or four days after William's arrival in
Union City, he was informed by the superintendent
of the express company having charge
of the operation, that there was a young man in
Moscow who could give important information<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
relative to the first robbery at that place. This
young man, Thomas Carr by name, was a lawyer
who had once had fine prospects, but he had become
very dissipated, and he finally had been taken
seriously ill, so that he had lost his practice. On
recovering his health he had reformed his habits,
but he had found great difficulty in winning back
clients, and his income was hardly enough to
support him. On learning that this impecunious
lawyer had valuable information, William
strongly suspected that it would amount to little
more than a good lie, invented to obtain money
from the express company; nevertheless, he sent
for the young man and heard his story.</p>

<p>According to Carr, a man named John Witherspoon
had visited him about six weeks before,
and had asked him whether he would like to get
a large sum of money. Carr replied affirmatively,
of course, and wished to know how it could be
obtained. Witherspoon had said that the express
company could be robbed very easily by boarding
a train at any water-tank, overpowering the messenger,
and making him open the safe. Witherspoon
also had said that he and several others
had robbed a train at Moscow some weeks before,
and that they had got only sixteen hundred dollars,
but that they should do better next time.
He had asked Carr to go to Cairo and find out
when there would be a large shipment of money
to the South; then Carr was to take the same
train and give a signal to the rest of the party on
arriving at the designated spot.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>On hearing Carr's story, William sent him back
to Moscow with instructions to renew his intimacy
with Witherspoon, and to report any news
he might learn at once; in case it should prove
to be of any value, the company would pay him
well for his services. It is hardly necessary to add
that Mr. Carr, having failed to get, as he had
hoped, a roving commission as detective at the
company's expense, was not heard from again,
his bonanza of news having run out very quickly
on discovering that no money was to be paid in
advance.</p>

<p>The next case was a more plausible one, and
William began its investigation with the feeling
that something might be developed therefrom.
It was learned that a former express messenger
named Robert Trunnion, who had been discharged
several months before, had been hanging
around Columbus, Kentucky, ever since. While
in conversation with the clerk of a second-class
hotel, Trunnion had spoken of the ease with
which a few determined men could board an express
car, throw a blanket over the messenger's
head, and then rob the safe. The clerk said that
Trunnion had made the suggestion to him twice,
and the second time he had given Trunnion a
piece of his mind for making such a proposition.
Trunnion had then said he was only fooling, and
that he did not mean anything by it. William
learned that Trunnion was then engaged in selling
trees for a nursery at Clinton, Kentucky, and that
he was regarded as a half-cracked, boasting fool,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
who might be anything bad, if he were influenced
by bold, unscrupulous men. William therefore
paid a visit to Mr. Trunnion, whom he found to
be a very high-toned youth, too fiery-tempered
and sensitive to submit to any questioning as to
his words or actions. In a very brief space of
time, however, his lordly tone came down to a
very humble acknowledgment that he had used
the language attributed to him; but he protested
that he had meant nothing; in short, his confession
was not only complete, but exceedingly
candid; he admitted that he was a gas-bag and a
fool, without discretion enough to keep his tongue
from getting him into trouble continually; and,
having clearly shown that he was nowhere in the
vicinity of either robbery, he asked humbly not
to be held responsible for being a born idiot.
William was satisfied that the fellow had told
the truth, and, after scaring him out of all his
high-toned pride, he let him go, with a severe
lecture on the danger of talking too much.</p>

<p>On the nineteenth of November, when the identity
of the robbers had been fully established,
William was called away to Iuka, Mississippi, on
information received from Mr. O'Brien, the general
superintendent of the express company, that
a man named Santon had seen the leader of the
party in that place, just a week before. Santon
represented that he knew the man well, having
been acquainted with him for years in Cairo, and
that he could not be mistaken, as he had spoken
with him on the day mentioned. William found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
that the man Santon was a natural liar, who could
not tell the truth even when it was for his interest
to do so. The descriptions of the various robbers
had been scattered broadcast everywhere,
and none of them were represented as over thirty-five
years of age; yet Santon said that his man
was over fifty years old, and that he had been a
pilot on the Mississippi for years. This was a
case&mdash;not an infrequent one, either&mdash;where people
talk and lie about a crime for the sole purpose
of getting a little temporary notoriety. Owing to
various accidents and railway detentions, William
lost three days in going to hunt up this lying
fellow's testimony.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most impudent of all the stories
brought to the express company's officers was
that of a man named Swing, living at Columbus,
Kentucky. He sent a friend to Union City to tell
them that he could give them a valuable clue to
the identity of the robbers, and William accompanied
this friend back to Columbus. On the
way, William drew out all that Swing's friend
knew about the matter, and satisfied himself
that Swing's sole object in sending word to the
officers of the company was to get them to do a
piece of detective work for him. It appeared that
his nephew had stolen one of his horses just after
the robbery, and he intended to tell the company's
officers that this nephew had been engaged in the
robbery; then if the company captured the
nephew, Swing hoped to get back his horse. A
truly brilliant scheme it was, but, unfortunately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
for his expectations, William could not be misled
by his plausible story; and, if he ever recovered
his horse, he did so without the assistance of the
express company. Nevertheless, he took William
away from his work for nearly a whole day,
at a time when his presence was almost indispensable.</p>

<p>Another peculiar phase of a detective's experience
is, that while following up one set of criminals,
he may accidentally unearth the evidences
of some other crime; occasionally it happens that
he is able to arrest the criminals thus unexpectedly
discovered, but too often they take the alarm
and escape before the interested parties can be put
in possession of the facts. About two weeks after
the Union City robbery, in the course of my extended
inquiries by telegraph, I came across a
pair of suspicious characters in Kansas City, Missouri.
I learned that two fine-looking women
had arrived in that city with about eight thousand
dollars in five, ten, and twenty dollar bills, which
they were trying to exchange for bills of a larger
denomination. The women were well dressed,
but they were evidently of loose character, and
the possession of so much money by two females
of that class excited suspicion instantly in the
minds of the bankers to whom they applied, and
they could not make the desired exchange. One
of the women was a blonde and the other was a
brunette. They were about of the same height,
and they dressed in such marked contrast as to
set each other off to the best advantage; indeed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
their dresses seemed to have attracted so much
attention that I could gain very little acquaintance
with their personal appearance. I could not connect
them in any way with the robbery at Union
City, nor with any other recent crime, though I
had little doubt that the money they had with
them was the proceeds of some criminal transaction;
still, having my hands full at that time, it
would have been impossible for me to look after
them, even had I thought best to do so. As it is my
practice to undertake investigations only when
engaged for the purpose by some responsible person,
I did not waste any time in endeavoring to
discover the source whence these women obtained
their money; though, of course, had I learned
enough about them to suspect them of complicity
in any specific crime, I should have reported my
suspicions to the parties interested, to enable them
to take such action as they might have seen fit.</p>

<p>The most important of all the false clues
brought out in this investigation was presented
by a noted confidence man and horse-thief named
Charles Lavalle, <i>alias</i> Hildebrand. I call it the
most important, not because I considered it of any
value at the time, but because it illustrates one of
the most profitable forms of confidence operation,
and because the express company, by refusing to
accept my advice in the matter, were put to a
large expense with no possibility of a return.</p>

<p>Very shortly after the Union City robbery, a
letter was received from a man in Kansas City,
calling himself Charles Lavalle. The writer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
claimed that he had been with the gang who had
robbed the train, but that they had refused to
divide with him, and so, out of revenge, he was
anxious to bring them to punishment. He claimed
further that he was then in the confidence of another
party, who were soon going to make another
raid upon the express company somewhere between
New Orleans and Mobile.</p>

<p>The plausibility of his story was such that he
obtained quite a large sum from the express
company to enable him to follow up and remain
with the gang of thieves with whom
he professed to be associated. No news was
received from him, however, and at length
I was requested to put a "shadow" upon
his track. My operative followed him to
St. Joseph, Missouri, and thence to Quincy, Illinois,
but, during two weeks of close investigation,
no trace of the villains in Lavalle's company could
be found, and he was never seen in the society of
any known burglars or thieves. It was soon evident
that he was playing upon the express company
a well-worn confidence game, which has
been attempted probably every time a large robbery
has occurred in the last fifteen years. He
became very importunate for more money while
in Quincy, as he stated that the gang to which
he belonged were ready to start for New Orleans;
but, finding that his appeals were useless, and
that no more money would be advanced until
some of his party were actually discovered and
trapped through his agency, he soon ceased writing.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>The foregoing are only a few of the instances
in which our attention was diverted from the
real criminals; and, although the efforts of my
operatives were rarely misdirected in any one affair
for any length of time, still these false alarms
were always a source of great annoyance and embarrassment.</p>




<p class="center">CHAPTER III.
</p>

<blockquote><p><i>"Old Hicks," a drunken Planter, is entertained by a
Hunting-party.&mdash;Lester's Landing.&mdash;Its Grocery-store
and Mysterious Merchants.&mdash;A dangerous
Situation and a desperate Encounter.&mdash;The unfortunate
Escape of Two of the Robbers.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>One of the most direct sources of information
relative to the party was found in the person
of an old planter, named Hicks, who lived
some distance down the track of the railroad. He
was in the habit of visiting Union City very frequently,
and he usually rounded off his day's
pleasure by becoming jovially drunk, in which
condition he would start for his home, walking
down the railroad track. He had been in Union
City all of Friday before the robbery, and about
ten o'clock in the evening he was in a state of
happy inebriety, ready to "hail fellow, well met,"
with any person he might encounter.</p>

<p>On his way home, about three-quarters of a mile
west of Union City, he saw a camp-fire burning a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
short distance from the track, and around it were
gathered five men. They hailed him, and asked
him to take a drink; and as this was an invitation
which Hicks could not refuse, even from the devil
himself, he joined them, drank with them, and
danced a hornpipe for their edification. Hicks
acknowledged in his account of meeting them, that
by the time they had made him dance for them,
he was heartily frightened at their looks and talk.
He heard one of them say that they wanted ten
thousand at least, but he could not tell what the
remark referred to. He asked them why they
were camping out, and one, who seemed to be the
leader of the party, said they were out hunting.</p>

<p>"Yes," continued another one, "I am out hunting
for somebody's girl, and when I find her we
are going to run away together."</p>

<p>At this, they all laughed, as if there was some
hidden meaning in his words.</p>

<p>Hicks described all of the men, three of them
quite minutely; but the fourth was evidently the
same as the second, and the fifth was lying down
asleep all the time, so that Hicks could not tell
much about him. They were armed with large
navy revolvers, which they wore in belts, and
their clothing was quite good. The tall man, who
seemed to be the leader, related an account of a
deer-hunt in which he had participated, in Fayette
county, Illinois, on the Kaskaskia river, and
when he mentioned the place, the others scowled
and winked at him, as if to stop him. Hicks said
that they seemed to be familiar with Cincinnati,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
Louisville, Evansville, and other northern cities,
and that they talked somewhat like Yankees.
He remained with them until about midnight,
when a negro came down the track. Hicks and
the negro then went on together to Hicks's house,
leaving the five men still camped in the woods.</p>

<p>Other persons reported having seen the same
party in the same vicinity several times before
the night of the robbery, though some had seen
only two, others three and four; but no one, except
Hicks, had seen five. The accounts given by
the persons near the train when the robbery occurred
did not show the presence of more than
three persons, though possibly there might have
been a fourth. The descriptions of the suspected
parties were quite varied in some respects; yet
the general tenor of them was to the same effect,
and, as no one knew who these persons were, it
was quite certain that this quartette of strangers
had committed the robbery.</p>

<p>In the case of the Moscow robbery, we had
strongly suspected two notorious thieves, named
Jack Nelson and Miles Ogle, so that my first action,
on learning of this second affair in the same
vicinity, was to telegraph to my correspondents
and agents throughout the country, to learn
whether either of these men had been seen lately.
I could gain no news whatever, except from St.
Louis, whence an answer was returned to the
effect that Nelson was said to be stopping somewhere
in the country back of Hickman, Kentucky.
Ogle's wife was in St. Louis, and she had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
been seen by a detective walking and talking earnestly
with a strange man a short time previous.
The information about Nelson was important,
since, if true, it showed that he was in the immediate
neighborhood of the points where the robberies
had occurred. The man seen with Mrs.
Ogle might have been one of the party, sent by
her husband to appoint a future rendezvous. The
description of the tall, dark man, mentioned by
Hicks and others, tallied very closely with Ogle's
appearance. My son, William, was well advised
of these facts, and, as soon as he had obtained the
statements of every one acquainted with any of
the occurrences at the time of the robbery, he was
ready for action.</p>

<p>His first inquiries were directed toward discovering
where Nelson was staying near Hickman,
and he learned in a very short time that this rumor
had no truth in it. While making search for
Nelson, however, he heard of a low grocery-store
at Lester's Landing, about twelve miles below
Hickman on the Mississippi River. The store
was situated four miles from any other house in
a sparsely settled country, where the amount of
legitimate trade would hardly amount to twelve
hundred dollars per year. It was said to be the
resort of a very low class of men, and the proprietors
passed for river gamblers.</p>

<p>On William's return to Union City from Hickman,
he decided to make a visit to this grocery-store
to learn something about the men who frequented
it. Having none of his own men with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
him, he chose one of the express company's detectives,
named Patrick Connell, to accompany
him, and, on the last day of October, they started
on horseback, with an old resident named Bledsoe
for a guide. On arriving at the house of a well-to-do
planter, named Wilson Merrick, they obtained
considerable information about the men who kept
the store and the people who visited it.</p>

<p>Mr. Merrick said that a man named John Wesley
Lester kept a wood-yard on the Mississippi,
and the spot was called Lester's Landing. About
three or four months before, three men arrived
there and obtained leave from Lester to put up a
store, which they stocked with groceries and
whisky. The men gave their names as J. H.
Clark, Ed. J. Russell, and William Barton, and
they seemed to have some means, as the store
did only a limited business, except in whisky.
They were all men of ability and determination,
and, as they were always well armed, the people
of the cane-brake country were rather afraid of
them. Nothing positive was known against
them, but it was suspected from their looks and
actions that they were Northern desperadoes lying
quiet for a time. They seemed to be well acquainted
in Cincinnati, Louisville, St. Louis,
Memphis, Vicksburg, and New Orleans, but they
were careful never to give any hint of their previous
place of residence in the hearing of strangers.
Mr. Merrick had, however, heard Russell
say that he had once run a stationary engine in
Missouri, and from occasional expressions by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
Barton it would appear that the latter had once
worked on a railroad in some capacity. They
dressed quite well, and treated strangers politely,
though not cordially. Although they were all
three rather hard drinkers, they never became
intoxicated, and they seemed to understand each
other well enough not to quarrel among themselves.
Clark was the oldest of the party, but
Russell seemed to be the leader, Barton being apparently
quite a young man. They stated that
they intended to exchange groceries for fish and
game, and ship the latter articles to St. Louis
and Memphis.</p>

<p>From the description of the men, William began
to suspect that they formed a portion of the
party of robbers, and he determined to push on
at once. He induced a young man named Gordon
to go with him as guide and to assist in making
the arrest of these men, if he should deem it
advisable. By hard riding they succeeded in
reaching Lester's Landing before nightfall, but
the twilight was fast fading as they came out of
the dense underbrush and cane-brake into the
clearing around Lester's log-cabin.</p>

<p>The spot was dreary and forlorn in the extreme.
The river was then nearly at low water, and its
muddy current skirted one side of the clearing at
a distance of about thirty yards from the house.
The wood-yard and landing at the water's level
were some ten or fifteen feet below the rising
ground upon which the house stood. The store
was a shanty of rough pine boards with one door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
and one window, and it stood at the head of the
diagonal path leading from the landing to the high
ground. A short distance back was a rail fence
surrounding Lester's house and cornfield, and
back of this clearing, about one hundred yards
from the house, was a dense cane-brake. The
corn-stalks had never been cut, and, as they grew
very high and thick within twenty feet of the
house, they offered a good cover to any one approaching
or retreating through them. A rough
log barn stood a short distance inside the rail
fence, and, like the house, it was raised several
feet above the ground, on account of the annual
overflow of the whole tract. The house was a
rather large building built of logs, the chinks being
partly filled with mud, but it was in a dilapidated
condition, the roof being leaky and the
sides partly open, where the mud had fallen out
from between the timbers.</p>

<p>On entering the clearing, William's party rode
up to the store and tried to enter, but, finding
the door locked, they approached the house. At
the rail fence, William and Connell dismounted,
leaving Gordon and Bledsoe to hold their horses.
Up to this time, they had seen no signs of life
about the place, and they began to think that the
birds had flown. The quiet and the absence of men
about the clearing did not prevent William from
exercising his usual caution in approaching the
house; but he did consider it unnecessary to take
any stronger force into an apparently unoccupied
log-cabin, where at most he had only vague sus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>picions
of finding the objects of his search;
hence, he left Gordon and Bledsoe behind. Knowing
the general construction of this class of
houses to be the same, he sent Connell to the rear,
while he entered the front door. A wide hall divided
the house through the center, and the occupants
of the house were in the room on the right.
William's door leading into the room opened
from this hall, while Connell's was a direct entrance
from the back porch, and there were no
other doors to the room.</p>

<p>As the two strangers entered simultaneously,
five men, a woman, and a girl started to their
feet and demanded what they wanted. The
situation was evidently one of great danger to
the detectives; one glance at the men, coupled
with the fierce tones of their inquiries, showed
William that he had entered a den of snakes
without adequate force; but it was too late to
retreat, and he replied that they were strangers
who, having lost their way, desired information.</p>

<p>The scene was a striking one, and it remains as
vividly in William's mind to-day, as if it had
occurred but yesterday. In the center of the
room, opposite him, was a broad fireplace, in
which the smouldering logs feebly burned and
gave forth the only light in the room. In one
corner stood several shot-guns, and in another,
four or five heavy axes. Grouped about near
the fire, in different attitudes of surprise, defiance,
and alarm, were the occupants of the cabin,
while to the left, in the half-open door stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Connell. The flickering flame of the rotten wood
gave a most unsatisfactory light, in which they
all seemed nearly as dark as negroes, so that
William asked the woman to light a candle. She
replied that they had none, and at the same
moment a young fellow tried to slip by Connell,
but he was promptly stopped. Another large,
powerful man, whose name afterward proved to
be Burtine, again demanded, with several oaths,
what their business was.</p>

<p>"I've told you once that I want some information,"
replied William, "and now I intend to
have you stop here until I can take a look at your
faces."</p>

<p>While William was making them stand up in
line against the wall, one of the largest drew a
navy revolver quickly and fired straight at
William's stomach, the ball just cutting the flesh
on his left side. At the same instant, the young
fellow previously mentioned, darted out the door,
Connell having sprang to William's side, thinking
him seriously wounded. Connell's approach prevented
William from returning the fire of the
tall man, who had jumped for the door also the
moment he had fired. William fired two shots
at him through the doorway, and Connell followed
him instantly, on seeing that William was unhurt.
Once outside, the tall fellow sprang behind
a large cottonwood tree and fired back at Connell
and William, who were in full view on the porch.
The second shot struck Connell in the pit of the
stomach, and he fell backward. At this moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a><br /><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>the powerful ruffian, Burtine, seized William
from behind and tried to drag him down, at the
same time calling for a shot-gun "to finish the
Yankee&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;." Turning suddenly upon
his assailant, William raised his revolver, a heavy
Tranter, and brought it down twice, with all his
force, upon Burtine's head. The man staggered
at the first blow and fell at the second, so that,
by leveling his revolver at the other two, William
was able to cow them into submission. The
affray had passed so quickly that it was wholly
over before Gordon and Bledsoe could reach the
house, though they had sprung from their horses
on hearing the first shot.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <i>The fight at Lester's Landing.</i>&mdash;<i>Page</i>&mdash;]</p>

<p>The two men had escaped by this time into the
dense cane-brake back of the house, and it was
necessary to attend to those who had been secured,
and to examine the injuries of Connell and
Burtine. The latter's head was in a pretty bad
condition, though no serious results were likely
to follow, while Connell had escaped a mortal
wound by the merest hair's breadth. He was
dressed in a heavy suit of Kentucky jeans, with
large iron buttons down the front of the coat.
The ball had struck one of these buttons, and, instead
of passing straight through his vitals, it had
glanced around his side, cutting a deep flesh furrow
nearly to the small of his back, where it had
gone out. The shock of the blow had stunned
him somewhat, the button having been forced
edgewise some distance into the flesh, but his
wound was very trifling, and he was able to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
on with the search with very little inconvenience.
Having captured three out of the five inmates of
the cabin, William felt as though he had done as
much as could have been expected of two men
under such circumstances, and he then began a
search of the premises to see whether any evidence
of their connection with the robbery could
be found. Absolutely no clue whatever was
obtained in the cabin and barn, nor did the store
afford any better results so far as the robbery was
concerned, but on this point William was already
satisfied, and he was anxious to get all information
possible about these so-called storekeepers.
In the store, he found bills and invoices showing
that the stock of goods had been purchased in
Evansville, but there was no other writing of any
character except some scribbling, apparently done
in an idle moment, upon some fragments of
paper in a drawer. On one was written: "Mrs.
Kate Graham, Farmington, Ill."; and on another,
amid many repetitions of the name, "Kate Graham,"
were the words, "My dear cousin."</p>

<p>Having found very little of value, the party returned
to the three prisoners and closely
examined them. To William's intense chagrin, he
found that these men were, undoubtedly, mere
wood-choppers living with Lester and having no
connection with the proprietors of the store.
Although desperate, brutal, and reckless, ready
for a fight at all times, as shown in this affray,
they were clearly not the train robbers, while it
was equally evident that the two who had escaped
were the guilty parties.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>William learned that the young man who had
first slipped out was Barton, and the man who
had done the shooting was Russell. Clark, they
said, had taken the steamer for Cape Girardeau,
Missouri, two days before, accompanied by a
married woman, named Slaughter. The description
of the train robbers tallied so well with the
appearance of Barton and Russell, that, taking
their actions into consideration, there could no
longer be any doubt of their complicity in the
affair, and it was highly provoking that these
two should have escaped. Still, it was an accident
which could hardly have been avoided. The
fact that the express company would not consent
to the employment of a larger force of detectives
was the principal cause of this misfortune, for it
could have been prevented easily, had William
been accompanied by two more good men of my
force.</p>

<p>As it was, two detectives, dropping unexpectedly
upon a nest of five villainous-looking men in
the dark, could have hardly hoped to do better
than to secure three of them. It could not have
been supposed that they would know which were
the important ones to capture, especially as they
could not distinguish one from another in the
uncertain light. Indeed, as afterward appeared,
they were fortunate in having escaped alive, for
the close approach to fatal wounds, which they
both received, showed how deadly had been the
intentions of the man Russell, while Burtine had
evidently intended that they should never leave
the house alive.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be supposed that the shooting on both
sides was none of the best, but it must be remembered
that it began without warning, and was
over in two minutes. It cannot be expected that
snap-shooting, even at close quarters, should be
very accurate; yet it was afterward learned that
Russell's escape had been about as narrow as
William's, two balls having passed through his
clothes and grazed his flesh.</p>

</p>

not join in the Search for the Outlaws.&mdash;One of
the Robbers is Taken, but subsequently Escapes from

<p>Having searched the whole place, and satisfied
himself that the men captured had
had no connection with the robbery or the robbers,
William offered them one hundred dollars
to act as guides through the cane-brake to arrest
Barton and Russell. They said they could not if
they would, since no man could find his way
there in broad daylight, much less at night. They
further admitted that they dare not attempt it, as
Russell would kill them if they learned of their
action. It was now pitch dark, and after a vain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
attempt to beat through the cane in search of the
fugitives, William decided to return to Mr. Merrick's
until next day.</p>

<p>The next morning at daybreak he started back
for Lester's, accompanied by a number of the
cane-brake population, all of whom were anxious
to secure the one hundred dollars reward. They
had long suspected the men at the store of being
desperadoes, but they had had a wholesome fear
of them on account of their fierce ways and their
reckless habit of drawing their revolvers on slight
provocation.</p>

<p>On arriving at Lester's, the party found that
Lester had returned from Hickman during the
night. He was a treacherous-looking scoundrel,
and his reputation was bad, although he had
never been caught in any crime in that vicinity.
His name, John Wesley Lester, showed that he
must have once belonged to a pious Methodist
family, and, indeed, he claimed to have once
been a Methodist preacher himself. He had
sunken eyes, milky white, and his hair was lank
and long; his complexion was dark, cheeks hollow,
chin pointed, and forehead low. His manner
was fawning and obsequious to those above
him, and he looked and acted like a second
"Uriah Heap." He pretended to know nothing
of Russell, Clark, and Barton, except that they
had come to his place in July, built the store
there, and had been around the landing more or
less ever since. He said that he knew nothing
against them, except that they were gamblers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
and that they often went off on gambling excursions,
during one of which, according to their
own statements, they had killed a man in a quarrel.</p>

<p>William learned from Lester's daughter that
Barton had returned during the night to get a
shawl, blanket, and two shot-guns. He had
told her that Russell was hurt pretty badly, but
that they intended to take the first packet down
the river. From other parties William learned
that the packet Julia had passed down during the
night, and had stopped at a point about seven
miles below, having been hailed from the bank.
He did not place much faith in the theory that the
men had taken passage by the Julia, for the reason
that Lester's girl was too anxious to tell the
story of the route Barton proposed taking. He
discovered that Barton had been paying lover-like
attentions to the girl, and he believed that Barton
had instructed her to say that he intended
taking the next packet, in order to give them a false
scent. Having set the men of the neighborhood
at work searching for Russell and Barton, William
returned to Union City.</p>

<p>From Hickman Connell was sent to Cape
Girardeau, Missouri, to capture Clark, who was
said to have gone there three days before.</p>

<p>On the arrival of William in Union City, the
superintendent telegraphed to me the result of
William's visit to Lester's Landing, and authorized
me to send an operative to Farmington,
Illinois, to hunt up Mrs. Kate Graham, and learn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
what she could tell about Russell, Clark, and
Barton. A man was sent there the next day, and
he had no difficulty in finding Mrs. Graham, who
proved to be the wife of a highly respectable
business man. She was a member of the church,
and was held in high esteem by every one acquainted
with her. My agent, therefore, called
upon her without any circumlocution or deception,
and asked to see her on business. She was confined
to her room by illness, but she saw him
for a few minutes, and answered his questions so
frankly that there was no doubt she was telling
the truth. She stated that she was not acquainted
with any one living at Lester's Landing;
that she did not know, nor ever had known, any
persons of the names given (Russell, Clark, and
Barton); and that she knew no one who would
answer to their descriptions. This clue seemed to
come to an end very quickly, yet it afterward
proved to be the means by which we captured one
of the gang, and it was a striking instance of the
necessity for the most careful and minute inquiry
upon every point of news obtained, especially
upon those received directly from the criminals
themselves.</p>

<p>On the 3d of November, Connell went with a
constable to the house of Mrs. Gully, the mother
of Clark's companion, Mrs. Slaughter, and there
he found them both. Clark was surprised by the
officers, but he made a bold fight, and was overpowered
with difficulty. When finally handcuffed
and searched, a navy revolver and fifty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
dollars in money were taken from him; he was
then taken nine miles on horseback to Cape Girardeau,
where Connell obtained a light wagon to
drive sixteen miles to Allenville, on the railroad
leading to Hickman. On this trip Connell made
the mistake of trusting to handcuffs alone, instead
of securely fastening his prisoner's feet
with rope. The idea that one man in handcuffs
could escape from two active, unimpeded men did
not, however, occur to Connell, and so the constable
drove the horse, while Clark and Connell
occupied the back seat. In justice to Connell, it
should be stated that he had been constantly in
the saddle for several days in raw and rainy
weather, and had had very little sleep for two
nights previous.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock in the evening, when only a
mile from Allenville, Clark suddenly made a leap
out of the wagon. The horse was jogging along
at a good trot, and, though Connell sprang after
his prisoner instantly, it was a couple of minutes
before the constable could follow. As he ran,
Connell fired at the dim figure disappearing in
the thick brush; but the next instant he pitched
headlong into a deep mud-hole, and, by the time
he got out, the cylinder of his revolver was
choked with mud, and Clark was far in advance.
The chase was kept up as long as the pursuers
were able to distinguish the direction of his flight,
but, in the darkness of the gloomy woods, it was
impossible to follow an athletic fellow like Clark
with any hope of success. Connell returned to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Union City very much crestfallen, and reported
his misfortune. My first feeling, on learning the
news, was one of deep regret and anxiety at the
loss of one of the leaders of the gang; my second
thought was one of profound thankfulness that
my men were in no way responsible for it. The
situation was an illustration of the disappointments
and difficulties which are so often met in a
detective's experience; and, though I felt somewhat
discouraged, I was more than ever determined
that none of these men should eventually
escape, even though it should be necessary to follow
them for months.</p>

<p>The desire of the express company to employ
as few as possible of my operatives embarrassed
me exceedingly, for William was obliged to depend
upon strangers, and he had little confidence
in their ability or discretion. He was now satisfied
of the identity of the parties he was in search
of, and all that he needed was a small force of experienced
and reliable men.</p>

<p>Had I been limited and interfered with in the
Maroney case, described in "The Expressman and
the Detective," as I was in this, there is no doubt
that I might have failed to capture the criminal;
but the cordial coöperation and support of the
Adams Express Company gave me a fair opportunity
to work to good advantage, and victory
was the result.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>




<p class="center">CHAPTER V.
</p>

<blockquote><p><i>A Rich Lead Struck at Last.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>William was quite sure, from the reputation
and actions of Russell, Clark, and
Barton, that they had been the leaders in the robbery,
and he believed that Lester could give important
information about them; he therefore
caused Lester to be brought to Union City, and,
on November 5, he succeeded in getting a statement
of the doings of these men since Lester had
known them. The important points developed
were as follows:</p>

<p>They came to Lester's Landing in the middle of
July, and built their store. They were rarely
there together, as they would go off for two or
three weeks at a time, leaving Barton or Clark in
charge, and sometimes putting Lester in as storekeeper
during the absence of all three. On one
occasion, Russell showed him a pocket-book containing
nearly one thousand dollars, which he
thought he had lost, but which he found under a
rail fence where he had hidden it; the other men,
also, seemed to have plenty of money. About
the middle of October, the three storekeepers
went away, and were gone until October 24, three
days after the robbery, on which day Lester met
Clark and Barton walking toward his house, on
the way from Hickman. They seemed quite ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>cited,
and said that they had been engaged in a
difficulty, but they did not state what it was.
They asked him whether he had seen Russell recently,
and also whether there was a skiff at his
landing; both questions were answered negatively,
and they passed on toward the store, while
Lester continued his walk to Hickman. On his
return at night, he found that Clark and Barton
had been across the river all day, scouting the
Missouri shore for Russell, and that shortly after
their return, Russell had come across the river in
a skiff. Russell said that he had been shot, but
that he was not much hurt, and he did not seem
to act as if he had been hurt at all. Sunday morning,
October 29, Clark took passage in a steamer
for Cape Girardeau, having Mrs. Slaughter in
company, and it was understood that he was going
with Mrs. Slaughter to the house of her
mother, nine miles from the Cape. Tuesday
evening, William and Connell arrived at Lester's,
the fight took place, and Barton and Russell
escaped. After the detectives had gone back to
Campbell's, Barton returned to the house and
obtained a shawl, blanket, and two shot-guns;
he said that they would never be taken alive, but
that Russell had been badly wounded by one of
the detectives. William had left two men at the
landing the next day to capture the men if they
returned, but they were afraid to attempt it, although
they had a good opportunity that night.
Russell came into the house alone, showing no
signs of having been wounded, and said that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
and Barton had joined four friends, who were
outside waiting for him; that they were all well
mounted and armed, and that they intended to
kill any one who should betray them or attempt
their capture. He added that they intended to
make their way on horseback to Alabama, and
that they were strong enough to fight their way
through, if necessary. Of course, Russell's object
was to frighten the detectives and others who
were searching for him, as he had no one with
him except Barton.</p>

<p>Among other points of value in Lester's statement,
was some incidental information relative
to the men, which he had learned during the time
they boarded with him. He had heard Clark say
that his mother lived sixty miles back of Nashville,
and Russell had once run a stationary engine
in Missouri. Lester was shown the satchel found
on the engine after the robbery, and he recognized
it as having been left at his house once by
a wood-chopper named Bill Taylor, who lived in
the cane-brake, some distance below him. He
said that the three men each carried a navy revolver
and a derringer, while Russell had also a
new, large-sized Smith &amp; Wesson revolver.</p>

<p>Meantime, the telegraph had been used constantly
to learn something about the three men,
Russell, Clark, and Barton, from whatever source
information could be obtained. Barton was well
known in Nashville, New Madrid, and Union
City. He was quite young, but he had been involved
in a stabbing affray in Nashville, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
regarded as a desperate character. He had been
respectably brought up by Major Landis, General
Agent of the Nashville and Northwestern Railroad,
and had been given a place in the employ
of that road, with good prospects for promotion.
Having become dissipated and hardened, he had
been discharged from his position, and Major
Landis had cast him off; thenceforward, his
career had been rapid in the downward direction.</p>

<p>With regard to the other two men, little could
be learned, until a rich lead was struck on the
seventh of November. The corrected descriptions
of the different parties having been sent to all the
agents of the express company, Mr. Charles Pink,
agent at Cairo, recognized Russell as a man who
had sent eight hundred dollars in currency from
Cairo to Mrs. M. Farrington, Gillem Station, Tennessee,
on the eleventh of September, and who
had then started, according to his own statement,
for his home in Illinois. Mr. Pink also stated
that the chief of police in Cairo claimed to know
Russell, and to be able to find him&mdash;for a sufficient
consideration. Not having any use for the
services of this disinterested officer, his offer was
politely declined.</p>

<p>The superintendent of the express company
was strongly impressed with the belief that Russell
and Barton were lurking around Lester's, and
so, while William went to Nashville to see what
could be learned about Barton and his companions,
a number of men were hired to scour the
country, hunt through the brake, and guard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Mississippi ferries, while Connell and Crowley,
the express messenger, were placed on the Missouri
bank, to scout that side of the river. I may
say here, <i>en passant</i>, that, with the exception of
the two named, these men were a source not only
of great unnecessary expense to the company,
but of vexation and hindrance to William. In
most cases, their scouting consisted in riding the
high-roads from one tavern to another, and in
order to have something to show for their work,
they would bring in every species of wild and
foolish rumor that they could discover or invent.
As the superintendent frequently desired that
these reports should be investigated, much valuable
time was thus wasted. These men were not
only employed without my advice, but they were
retained long after I had urgently requested the
discharge of the whole party, and I had great
difficulty in obtaining their discharge, even after
I was positively sure that the robbers had crossed
the Mississippi and escaped into Missouri.</p>

<p>William spent one day in Nashville, and then
went to Gillem Station, where he learned that
Mrs. Farrington, to whom Russell had sent eight
hundred dollars from Cairo, lived on an old, worn-out
farm, and passed for a rich widow. She had
three sons&mdash;Hillary, Levi, and Peter, the latter
being quite young. Hillary and Levi Farrington
bore a very bad reputation, having been mixed
up in all kinds of fights and quarrels for a number
of years. They were suspected of horse-stealing
and counterfeiting; but most people were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
afraid of them, and they had never been arrested
in that vicinity. William here learned, also, that
Barton had been a frequent visitor at the Farringtons',
and that he was as bad as the others.
While at Gillem Station, William met Pete Farrington,
the youngest of the three brothers, and
his resemblance to Russell, whose face William
had seen by the dim firelight and the flash of his
pistol in the cabin at Lester's Landing, caused a
sudden possibility to flash across his mind. He
reasoned out the connection of the different facts
about as follows:</p>

<p>"Russell was, undoubtedly, one of the Moscow
and Union City robbers, and he obtained a considerable
share of the plunder; two months after
the first robbery, I find that he sent eight hundred
dollars to Mrs. Farrington; this establishes
the connection of those two persons. Barton was
one of the actors in both robberies, also, and I
find that he was formerly intimate with Mrs.
Farrington and her sons; another link. Pete
Farrington bears a strong resemblance to Russell,
their peculiar Roman noses, with a lump in the
middle, being exactly alike, and this creates a
strong presumption that they belong to the same
family. Now, Russell and Clark were so similar
in their general appearance, that many people
who have seen them together believe them to
have been brothers. Hillary and Levi Farrington,
I am told, also closely resemble each other,
and they have not been seen about here for some
months, they being, according to their mother's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
account, in Texas. The chain of evidence is very
complete; what if Russell and Clark should prove
to be the Farrington brothers!"</p>




<p class="center">CHAPTER VI.
</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The Mother of the Farringtons, being arrested, boasts
that her Sons "Will never be taken Alive."&mdash;Another
Unfortunate Blunder by Amateur Detectives.&mdash;An
interesting Fate intended for the Detectives.&mdash;William
A. Pinkerton captures the Murderer of a Negro
in Union City, proving "a very good Fellow&mdash;for
a Yankee."&mdash;An Unfortunate Publication.&mdash;Nigger-Wool
Swamp and its Outlaws.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>The more William thought about it, the more
convinced he became that his theory was
correct, and he took steps to verify his suspicions
by placing a watch upon Mrs. Farrington's movements.
He also made arrangements to get possession
of any letters that might come for her,
and then, being hastily recalled by the superintendent
of the express company, he hurried back
to Union City.</p>

<p>He there learned that, during his absence, Clark
had talked with both Lester and his wife. The
latter had warned him of his danger, and he had
then disappeared in the cane-brake. The men
stationed at Lester's for the express purpose of
arresting any of the robbers who might come
there, had been either unaware of Clark's visit,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
or else they had been afraid to attempt his capture,
and he had escaped again when almost
within our grasp. William had, therefore, been
called back by telegraph to take charge of the
men engaged in beating through the cane-brake,
as it had been clearly demonstrated that, without
a determined leader, these men were no more
useful than a flock of sheep. The hunt went on
for several days with no results whatever, while
at the same time scouts patroled the highways,
and other men kept watch upon the ferries and
fords for many miles around.</p>

<p>While this was going on, the express agent at
Gillem Station was keeping a close watch upon
Mrs. Farrington, when suddenly she announced
her intention of going to join her sons in Texas.
Instead of sending word to William at once, the
agent began operations on his own account, and
when Mrs. Farrington arrived at Waverly, Tennessee,
he caused her arrest. She had started
with two new wagons and a complete outfit for
an overland journey of some length, so that her
progress could not have been very rapid, and
nothing would have been lost by waiting for instructions;
but the insane desire to play detective
seemed to overpower all other considerations in
the minds of the company's agents, and she was
arrested by the sheriff and a <i>posse</i> of citizens.
Her salutation to the officer who stopped her settled
the question of identity at once, for, on being
told that she would be obliged to let him search
her wagons for certain men, she replied:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! yes; I know what you want. You would
like to find my two sons and Barton for the express
robbery; but you will never catch them, for
they are not now in this country, and they will
never be taken alive."</p>

<p>This piece of information led the express agent
to take the only sensible step of his whole proceeding.
Mrs. Farrington had two negro families
with her, some of whom had belonged to her before
the war; and, with the personal attachment
noticeable in many of the colored people, they
were now desirous of going West with her. It
occurred to the agent that some of them, from
their confidential relations to the family, might
be able to give some information as to the whereabouts
of the boys. The negroes were, therefore,
taken separately and closely examined, until one
of the men was urgently persuaded to reveal
what he knew. He said that Levi, Hillary, and
Barton had committed the robbery, and that they
had since been at Mrs. Farrington's together.
According to an agreement between the mother
and her sons, she was to start for Texas, passing
through Nigger-Wool Swamp, on the west side of
the Mississippi, and the two eldest sons were to
meet her in the swamp, when they would determine
where to go.</p>

<p>The agent also learned that the men had arrived
at their mother's house Friday evening, November
10, and that a man who had gone there
to sell her a wagon had been met by Hillary Farrington
with a shot-gun; on seeing that it was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
neighbor, however, Hillary had lowered his gun
and allowed him to come in. It was also learned
that the three desperadoes had been seen at the
house of the Farringtons' uncle, named Douglas,
on Hurricane Creek, about ten miles from Waverly;
again, on Monday, they had been noticed
at Hurricane Mills, making their way to Fowler's
Landing, on the Tennessee River between Florence
and Johnsonville, fourteen miles from the
last-named place. It was evident that they intended
to strike across the country below Reel's
Foot Lake, and cross the Mississippi at some point
between Columbus and Memphis. The men were
all well mounted and armed, and they had
changed their personal appearance somewhat by
altering the arrangement of their hair, whiskers,
and beards.</p>

<p>The arrest of Mrs. Farrington was a most unfortunate
blunder, since it disclosed to the criminals
how close had been their pursuit, while little
really important information was obtained. It
was a good illustration of the danger of taking
any decided step in a criminal investigation before
knowing to a certainty that some good result
would be obtained. The parties thus learned that
we were not only aware of their identity, but
also that we were very close upon their track, and
the danger, as well as the difficulty, of the case
was largely increased. These men were desperadoes
of the most reckless type, and they would
not have hesitated a moment to lie in ambush
and kill their pursuers, if they had found it possible
to do so.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to intercept the fugitives before reaching
the swampy country near the Mississippi, the
number of scouts and patrolling parties was increased
by the superintendent of the express
company, and two men, named Ball and Bledsoe,
were engaged to follow Mrs. Farrington on horseback
until her sons should join her in Nigger-Wool
Swamp. This would have been a sensible
and necessary move if the right kind of men had
been employed; but the selection of untrained
men for the delicate and important work of
"shadowing" such an experienced gang of villains
was risky in the extreme. Had they ever
met Barton and the Farringtons, the latter would
have undoubtedly murdered both of them without
scruple; but there was no danger of such a
meeting, since the robbers, and Mrs. Farrington
also, were perfectly aware of the presence of their
pursuers from the start. Indeed, they afterward
stated that it had been their intention to have led
the detectives on as far as the wild, unsettled
country of Western Missouri, and to have then
hanged them in some unfrequented spot, placing
the inscription "Horse-thief" upon each of the
bodies. Subsequent events prevented them from
carrying out this plan, but there was no doubt
that they would have taken that or some other
equally daring means of ridding themselves of
pursuit. The manner in which Ball and Bledsoe
exposed their intentions wherever they went
showed the inexperience of both men in such
work; for, along the whole route over which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
they passed, they were known as officers tracking
a band of thieves; and we afterward learned
that, while they were innocently and unsuspectingly
following Mrs. Farrington, two of the men,
Barton and Clark, were almost continually watching
them. However, they had been started on
their mission by the superintendent before William
could make any other arrangements, as he
was away at Lester's Landing when the chase
began.</p>

<p>From William's reports to me, I saw the uselessness
of maintaining such a body of men in
the work of scouting, watching ferries, and beating
the cane-brake, for the reason that no good
could come of it. I knew that if the robbers could
escape from Lester's Landing and make their
way to Gillem Station once, they could do it
again. Clark (or Hillary Farrington) had been at
Lester's early Thursday morning, while guards
were stationed all about; yet, on Saturday morning
he was at his mother's farm, and no one had
even seen him on the way. This convinced me
that they had such a knowledge of the country
as to make it impossible to stop them by any system
of guards or patrols, and I therefore wrote
several letters asking that the superintendent discharge
this expensive force at once, and allow me
to manage the whole operation by my own plans
and with my own men. While William, therefore,
was at work with indefatigable energy and
perseverance, scouting and following up all the
reports brought in by the vast army of volunteer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
detectives in the company's employ, we were both
satisfied that the method adopted was useless, and
that even the ferry guards would discover nothing.
Knowing the character of the three desperadoes,
I had no doubt of their sagacity in avoiding
observation and pursuit; they would never
try to cross without knowing positively whether
the ferry was guarded, and if there should be any
real danger, they would undoubtedly steal a skiff
and make their horses swim across the river, a
feat of no great risk in the then low condition of
the water.</p>

<p>About this time an incident occurred which
added greatly to William's popularity in Union
City, and gained for him the respect and kindly
feeling of the community. On Sunday two
roughs, having drank enough bad whisky to be
absolutely fiendish, began to beat an old and inoffensive
negro whom they happened to meet. A
merchant, named Blakemore, who was passing at
the time, stopped to remonstrate with the ruffians,
when one of them turned and plunged a knife
into his stomach, inflicting a wound which caused
his death next day. The murderer was the terror
of the town, and so great was the fear of him
that he would have probably escaped had not
William appeared on the street as he rushed
away flourishing his bloody knife and threatening
to kill any one who should stand in his way.
The sight of William's heavy revolver leveled at
his head, backed by the certainty which he saw
in William's face that death or surrender was his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
only alternative, caused him to choose the latter,
and he was lodged in jail to await his trial for
murder. The people of the town were quite enthusiastic
over the way in which William had
brought the fellow to bay, and then compelled
his surrender; and they even went so far as to
say that he was "a good fellow, a very good fellow
indeed&mdash;for a Yankee."</p>

<p>On the twentieth of November an unfortunate
publicity was given to our operations by the publication
in the Union City <i>Journal</i> of a long history
of the Farringtons, showing their whole
career of crime, and terminating with an account
of their latest exploit, as developed by our investigations
in and about Union City. It is unnecessary
to state the source whence this information
was derived, further than to say that it was not
obtained from any member of my force. It was
a very dangerous piece of news to be published,
since it might have wholly overthrown all our
plans, besides involving the death of two or three
men engaged in the operation; fortunately, the
robbers were undoubtedly across the Mississippi
by that time, and beyond the reach of newspapers
for some weeks at least.</p>

<p>On the same day that this matter was published,
Mrs. Farrington crossed the Mississippi River at
Bird's Point, opposite Cairo, and the fact was reported
to William and to me by telegraph. We
had previously learned that Mrs. Farrington had
relatives in Springfield, Missouri, and in Dade
County, in the same State, and the probabilities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
were that, instead of going to Texas, she was
going to visit in one of these places. Meanwhile,
though my opinion was that her sons intended to
rejoin her somewhere, either in Nigger-Wool
Swamp or at her place of destination, I had no
certainty that such was their intention; and,
bearing in mind the warning they had received
by her arrest at Waverly (and possibly by reading
the newspaper article previously mentioned),
I felt that every clue must be carefully traced,
even though it might lead in an exactly opposite
direction from that in which our previous suspicions
had caused us to look. My correspondents
and agents in Louisville, Cincinnati, St. Louis,
and New Orleans were, therefore, kept on the
alert to capture the men if they should venture
into those cities, while I held three determined
men ready to go at once in pursuit of Mrs. Farrington,
in case she should take the route through
Nigger-Wool Swamp.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that one of the negroes
accompanying Mrs. Farrington had stated that
her sons were to join her in that swamp; now,
there were three possibilities about this statement:
first, the negro might have lied; second,
he might have been so informed by the old lady
on purpose to give a false scent in case he should
be questioned; and, third, while their intention
might have been to meet there, subsequent events
might have altered their plans. Still, thinking
the subject over carefully, I decided that she
would not take so difficult a course unless she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
really intended to meet her sons there. My reasons
for so thinking were based upon the nature
of the place, and, to comprehend my solicitude
about Nigger-Wool Swamp, a description of it
will be necessary.</p>

<p>The swamp is more than seventy miles long by
about thirty-five miles wide, and, as a piece of
bottomless ooze, its superior cannot be found in
the United States. There are just two roads
crossing it, one running from Hall's Ferry, at
Point Pleasant, Missouri, and the other from
Mitchell's Ferry, thirty-five miles below. These
roads are mere bog-paths in themselves, being
heavily overlaid with underbrush and corduroy
logs, yet they afford the only means of crossing
this vast morass. The period of the annual overflow
turns it into a turbid, sluggish lake, the roads
being then deeply buried under water; but even
in the dryest seasons the greater portion of the
swamp is a bottomless slime of mud and putrefying
vegetation. Large tracts of thickly-wooded
land are contained within the limits of the swamp,
and these constitute a semi-substantial basis for
the two roads which run through them; but even
these clumps are impassable at most seasons,
except along the artificially-constructed roads.
Sometimes, for miles and miles, nothing but the
rankest of swamp-vegetation is seen, growing in
wild profusion and covering the treacherous ooze
with a close network of leaves and branches,
until the surface looks firm enough to be taken
for solid ground; but should any unfortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
traveler venture to cross such a spot, his limbs
would be clogged by these clinging water-plants,
his feet would find no secure resting-place, and,
sinking rapidly deeper and deeper into the mire,
his bones would find a sepulcher where nothing
but a general natural convulsion would ever disturb
them.</p>

<p>Still, there are occasional islands of firm ground
through this section, and these have become the
resort of lawless characters of every nationality
and degree of crime. Over the entrance to Nigger-Wool
Swamp might be placed, with perfect
truthfulness, the motto: "Who enters here
leaves hope behind." Each man is a law unto
himself, and he must maintain his rights by the
strong arm and the ready shot-gun. In one thing
only are the dwellers of the swamp united,
namely: a bitter and deadly resistance to the
law. No officer of justice ventures therein to
perform any of the duties of his office; unless
backed by a powerful body of determined men,
he would never return alive, and, if so accompanied,
he would never succeed in catching a
glimpse of any criminal whom he might be
seeking.</p>

<p>About the middle of the swamp, the two roads
cross each other at a spot called "The Gates," and
every person traveling through either way must
pass this place. Knowing this fact, I felt sure
that Mrs. Farrington would await the arrival of
her sons at "The Gates," in case she entered the
swamp, and I determined that, in such an event,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
I should try to capture them there. I was fully
aware of the danger of such an attempt, but I
knew that to take the bull by the horns is sometimes
the safest means of overpowering him. To
send officers to that point with the avowed purpose
of arresting any one, would be equivalent to
sending them to their certain death, and I had no
intention of doing anything of the kind; but I
had men of my force who could visit Nigger-Wool
Swamp for the professed purpose of hiding
there from pursuit for alleged crimes, and, when
the moment came for action, I did not doubt that
they would bring out their men before the neighboring
outlaws could discover their object.</p>

<p>Everything depended upon the course Mrs. Farrington
should take on leaving the Mississippi
River, since by striking north from the point
where she crossed, she could skirt the edge of the
swamp, while if she turned south toward Point
Pleasant, I should know that she intended to
carry out her original programme. This question
was quickly settled, however, not only by the reports
of the scouts, Ball and Bledsoe, who were
following Mrs. Farrington, but also by an unexpected
piece of intelligence from Gillem Station.
Mrs. Farrington moved about twenty or twenty-five
miles each day, and, from the fact that she
went north to Fredericktown, there was no doubt
that she had changed her plan of meeting her
sons in Nigger-Wool Swamp.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span></p>




<p class="center">CHAPTER VII.
</p>

<p><i>The Scene of Action transferred to Missouri.&mdash;The
Chase becoming Hot.</i></p>


<p>On the twenty-second of November, William
learned that a letter had arrived at Gillem
Station, postmarked Verona, Missouri, November
13, and he immediately took measures to obtain
this letter. Three days later he learned its contents,
which were of such an important character
as to give a new direction to our efforts. The letter
read as follows:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">"<span class="smcap">Verona</span>, Mo., Nov. 13, 1871.</span><br />
</p>

<blockquote><p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Cousin</span>:</p>

<p>"I seat myself to answer your kind letter, which
came to hand last evening, and was glad to hear
from you, and hear you was well and doing well.
I have nothing new to write, only that we are all
well at present, hoping that when these few lines
come to hand they may find you well and doing
well as ever, as you say you have been doing very
well. It must be a good thing if it could stay so.
Sometimes it was well and sometimes it wasn't,
but I hope it will stay so, as you say it is a soft
thing&mdash;as soft as things gets to be. I would like
to see something like that, you bet. You talk like
it can't be beat. That is the thing to take in. I
think, and I know you think it, for I saw your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
name. I guess I did see you. You know Mr.
Crapmel? He is a great fellow; you bet it is so.
I have nothing more to write at present, as you
said you are going to start out here. You said you
was coming by here. Cousin, if you do come by,
we don't live where we did when you were here;
we live two miles nearer Verona. Come the same
road. We live now half mile off the road on John
Ellis' place. You can find out where we live anywhere.
Come out the same road you did when
you came before. John Timothy has just come
out here; has been out here about three weeks.
He is well satisfied here. So I will close for this
time.</p>

<p>
"From your cousin,<br />
"<span class="smcap">J. M. Durham.</span><br />
</p>

<p>"M. F. sends her love to all of the family. Excuse
my bad writing and bad spelling."</p></blockquote>

<p>It was evident that Mrs. Farrington had previously
written to her cousin informing him of
her intention to visit him soon, and this letter
was intended to direct her to the new location.
The allusions in the letter to the "good thing" in
which she was engaged showed that the writer
had been made aware of the Farringtons' success
as express robbers, and that he quite approved of
their operations.</p>

<p>On reading this letter, William sent a copy to
me immediately, and suggested that one or two
good men be sent to Verona to get work near this
man Durham, and to get into the confidence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the family, so that, when Mrs. Farrington should
arrive, she would not be likely to suspect any one
who had come before her. I fully approved of
William's plan, and, on the last day of November,
Detectives George W. Cottrell and Arthur C.
Marriott started for Verona. I inferred that the
people in that vicinity were rather lawless and
desperate characters, from the fact that Durham
spoke of "John Timothy" being well satisfied
there. On the principle that "birds of a feather
flock together," I judged the Farringtons, the Durhams,
and this fellow Timothy to belong to the
same type of people; hence, I concluded that, if
Durham and Timothy were satisfied with the
country, the people living there must be congenial
spirits, especially since Mrs. Farrington was about
to make a place of refuge in that vicinity.</p>

<p>My two men were detained a day in St. Louis,
and they did not arrive in Verona until the second
of December. The first thing they noticed
about the town was the total absence of liquor saloons,
and a few minutes' conversation with one
or two of the citizens convinced them that no
more orderly, honest, law-abiding community existed
in Missouri than the population of Lawrence
County. This discovery made a marked change
in their plans necessary, as my instructions to
them had been based upon the supposition that
they would find a number of robbers, horse-thieves,
and counterfeiters around Verona, and
that they would be easily able to get Durham's
confidence by appearing as reckless and desperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
as any one. They had each prepared a choice autobiography
for use among the residents, and, according
to their own intended accounts of themselves,
two greater scoundrels never went unhung.</p>

<p>All this was necessarily useless in the changed
circumstances surrounding them. To attempt the
<i>rôle</i> of criminal characters, hiding from justice,
would quickly cause their banishment from the
place, or possibly their arrest, and a new plan
was essential. Their instructions had been that
they should not put any confidence in any one,
and they were obliged to invent a plausible reason
for their presence there; also to have some
business which would enable them to ride about
the country, making inquiries and scouting for
Mrs. Farrington and her sons.</p>

<p>Finding that the railroad company had a land
agent in Verona, Cottrell decided to represent
themselves as would-be purchasers of land. This
would give them an excuse for going all over the
county, examining different farms and unimproved
tracts. They were introduced to Mr.
Purdy, the land agent, by the hotel clerk, and
from him they obtained a map of the county. It
was then agreed that Mr. Purdy should go out
with Cottrell and Marriott on Tuesday, December
5, to look at some pieces of property which the
railroad company wished to sell. During Sunday
and Monday both of the detectives were trying to
learn where Durham lived, but no one seemed to
know; neither could any one tell them anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
about John Ellis, upon whose farm Durham had
said he was living. The idea that Mrs. Farrington
was rapidly pushing west, toward Durham's place,
made Cottrell very anxious to begin operations
as quickly as possible, since, if she should arrive
before the detectives were established in the vicinity,
there would be great difficulty in working
into her confidence, as she would instantly suspect
their true character; whereas, if she should
find them already there, she would have no possible
occasion to distrust them. They therefore
thought best to confide the real object of their
visit to Mr. Purdy, the land agent, and to ask his
advice and assistance. Mr. Purdy had been an
officer in the Union army during the war of the
rebellion, and had settled in Verona at the close
of the war. He was evidently an honorable man,
who would always be found on the side of law
and order, and as he was very popular in Verona,
he would be able to give them a great deal of assistance
in capturing the Farrington party. On
communicating with me by telegraph on this
point, they stated the facts briefly, and I authorized
them to confer with Mr. Purdy on the subject,
at the same time forwarding full instructions
by letter.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, therefore, they told the whole
story to Mr. Purdy, and showed him their credentials.
He was quite astonished at their revelations,
but he was very hearty and sincere in his
expressions of good will toward them, and he
promised to aid them in every possible way. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
knew John Ellis quite well, having sold him the
farm on which he was living, and he had heard of
Durham, who hired a small portion of the Ellis
farm. He said that if force should be necessary
to capture the Farrington party, he could raise
fifty determined men in ten minutes to help the
officers. He said that after the war Verona had
been a very bad place for a short time, but that,
as Eastern men began to settle there, the respectable
people had tried to drive out the hard cases;
this had been slow work at first, but they eventually
had been completely successful; they not
only had driven out the dangerous characters, but
they had closed all the liquor saloons also; and
now, having once got rid of them, they would
take care not to let any of that class of people
back again.</p>

<p>Mr. Purdy was called away for a day or two on
business, but he promised, on his return, to go
with the detectives to Durham's place, and, meantime,
he said he would speak of them as gentlemen
who intended buying land in that section,
and who wished to ride over the country until
they found a place which satisfied them. During
the next three days, therefore, they learned
nothing new, their time being occupied in scouting
the road along which they expected Mrs. Farrington
to come.</p>

<p>Thus the first week of December passed, and
the operation was not progressing very favorably
anywhere. Ball and Bledsoe had reported Mrs.
Farrington's route up to the thirtieth of November,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
and she had moved quite rapidly up to that date,
but nothing had been learned since, and I expected
to hear of her arrival at Verona every day. She
had gone from Cairo to Frederickstown, Missouri,
and thence to Ironton; then, instead of following a
direct road, she had struck up north to Potosi, in
Washington County; again taking a westerly
route, she had passed through Steelville, Crawford
County, and on the thirtieth of November, she
had camped at Waynesville, Pulaski County.
Beyond this we knew nothing of her movements,
although by the eighth of December she had had
ample time to reach Verona.</p>

<p>William had spent this week in following up a
clue received from Louisville, Kentucky. It will
be remembered that about November 9, a pair of
dashing women had been reported as having
visited the banks in Kansas City, trying to get
large bills for about eight thousand dollars in small
bills. I had not believed the story at that time,
and therefore had taken no steps to follow them.
When William learned from Louisville, however,
that a woman named Annie Martin, whom Levi
Farrington had been in the habit of supporting
on the proceeds of his robberies, had been staying
there with another woman named Lillie
Baker, who had sustained the same relations to
Barton, it occurred to him that these might have
been the women who were said to have been in
Kansas City with so much money. He started
at once for Louisville, at the same time telegraphing
to me his suspicions in the matter, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
began inquiries again in Kansas City by telegraph.
I could learn very little except from the teller of
one bank, who described the women as well as he
could remember their appearance; but the description
was not accurate enough to determine
whether these two women had or had not been
Annie Martin and Lillie Baker. In Louisville,
however, William learned that these women had
been there recently, and they had appeared to be
well supplied with money. They had not remained
very long, but had gone to New Orleans,
where they were then living in good style. As
Mr. O'Brien, the general superintendent of the
express company, was in New Orleans, the information
was sent to him, and he agreed to have
a sharp watch kept to discover Farrington and
Barton, in case they should follow these women.</p>

<p>On the eighth of December, Cottrell, Marriott,
and Mr. Purdy started on horseback to visit John
Ellis's farm, where the Durhams lived. About a
mile before arriving there, they met a farmer
named Wisbey, who was a neighbor of Ellis and
the Durhams. Without letting him into their confidence,
they talked with him a long time, and
gradually drew out a number of important facts.
The Durham family consisted of two brothers and
a young sister living with their mother, old Mrs.
Durham, and they rented a small house on a part
of the Ellis farm. Nothing positive had ever been
discovered against the character of either James
or Tilman Durham, but the neighbors had a poor
opinion of them, and kept a pretty close watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
upon their actions. During the previous fall a
young man had visited them for some time, and
his description was exactly that of Levi Farrington;
but Wisbey could not tell his name, though
he promised to learn it, and let Mr. Purdy know
Mr. Wisbey was a downright honest, intelligent
man, and Mr. Purdy asked him to learn everything
possible about the Durhams and their visitors; in
case any wagons should arrive, it was agreed that
he should send word to Mr. Purdy instantly.
There was no occasion for telling him the whole
story, as he was quite willing to undertake the
trust on the strength of Mr. Purdy's request, without
asking further particulars; and, as he was a
thoroughly discreet man, there was little danger
that he would betray his mission by idle talking.
The detectives and Mr. Purdy then returned to
Verona, it being considered undesirable that they
should visit the Durhams, lest they might possibly
excite suspicion.</p>

<p>The day following their visit to Wisbey, he arrived
in Verona and told Cottrell that he had
sent his son-in-law, Mr. Stone, to see Jim Durham,
and the latter had said that he was expecting the
arrival of some relatives very soon. He had
learned further that the young man who had
visited Durham in the latter part of the previous
September had given his name as Levi Farrington,
and had passed as the beau of the young Durham
girl. In speaking of him, Jim Durham had told
Mr. Stone that he did not wish his sister to marry
Farrington, as the latter was a dangerous man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
and had recently killed a man in a quarrel, while
those who stood about were too much afraid of
him to arrest him. Mr. Wisbey then returned
home, with instructions to alternate with Mr.
Stone in secretly watching Durham's place, so that
every occurrence might be at once reported.</p>

<p>On the tenth of December I received a dispatch
from Mr. O'Brien, saying that the express agent
at Springfield, Missouri, had telegraphed to him
on the eighth that the wagons of Mrs. Farrington's
party had camped five miles from Springfield, and
that the three men were known to be sixty miles
south of Rolla. Mr. O'Brien therefore requested
me to send a good detective to meet Connell in
St. Louis, whence they would go together to capture
the men at Rolla. I at once sent one of my
best men, named Martin Galway, with instructions
to join Connell, and, in case the Rolla report
should prove to be a false alarm, they were to go
on to Verona to assist Cottrell and Marriott. I
had hardly completed my instructions to Galway,
ere I received a telegram in cipher from Cottrell,
as follows:</p>

<p>"Levi Farrington and a man calling himself
George Cousins are at Durham's. They came on
Thursday evening. Shall I arrest them? I can
get all the help I need."</p>

<p>I immediately replied, also by a cipher dispatch,
as follows:</p>

<p>"Are you sure it is Levi Farrington? His
brother and Barton will probably be at Verona
soon. We must get the whole. I think they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
will come from Douglas County. Probably Connell
and Galway will be with you by Monday or
Tuesday night; they can identify the men. Mrs.
Farrington will be at Durham's by Sunday night
or Monday morning. Keep a cool, clear head, and
advise with Purdy. Have written by mail to-night.
Keep me posted. William will arrive by
Tuesday."</p>

<p>At the same time I wrote full instructions to
Cottrell, ordering him to keep a close watch upon
the men at Durham's, but to take no action until
William should arrive, unless they attempted to
go away. I did not alter Galway's instructions,
but I telegraphed to William to start for Verona
at once, to take charge of the operations there.
The chase was now becoming hot, and a few days
would decide the question of success or failure. I
had reason to believe that the outlaws would not
be taken without a desperate resistance, and I
was anxious to have William present to direct
the attack.</p>

<p>On Sunday, the tenth, Cottrell and Marriott
rode out to see Wisbey, who met them just outside
of Verona and informed them that Levi
Farrington had arrived at Jim Durham's late
Thursday night, accompanied by a young man
named George Cousins. They did not receive
my reply to their telegram announcing this fact
until late that day, and so they could do nothing
toward satisfying themselves as to Levi Farrington's
identity until next morning, when they
visited Wisbey at his own house. Mr. Stone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
Wisbey's son-in-law, had met a man named
Smothers, who worked for Jim Durham, and
Smothers had told him all about the two men
who had just arrived. According to their own
account, they had left Mrs. Farrington at Ash
Grove, in Greene County, where she was going to
buy a farm, Levi having given her five thousand
dollars for that purpose; Levi and Cousins were
on their way to Kansas, where they intended to
settle down to raise cattle; Levi's brother was
said to be at Lester's Landing for the purpose of
selling off a stock of groceries which they owned
there. Both men were well armed, having three
navy revolvers and a shot-gun.</p>

<p>When this news was transmitted to me by
telegraph, I decided that this man Cousins must
be Barton, and that Hillary Farrington might possibly
be at Lester's Landing, as they said. I
therefore telegraphed to William, who I knew
would be in St. Louis that day, <i>en route</i> to
Verona, that he had better take Connell and
Galway back to Lester's to capture Hillary,
while Cottrell and Marriott undertook the arrest
of Levi and Barton at Durham's. I also sent a
dispatch to Cottrell to take no steps for their arrest
until after William should have captured
Hillary.</p>

<p>William, having previously thoroughly examined
the contents of the store at Lester's,
knew that they were not worth over two hundred
dollars, and he telegraphed me to that effect,
suggesting that it was improbable that Hillary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
should run so much risk for so small a sum. On
learning this fact, I coincided with him, and
ordered him to go on to Verona, as I had originally
intended. I desired that he should keep the
Durham place carefully watched until the arrival
of the other Farrington, who, I believed, would
soon join the rest of the party; then, in case he
arrived, we should get all three together; but, if
the other two should show any signs of moving
off, they could be taken at any time.</p>

<p>Mr. O'Brien obtained requisitions from the
Governor of Tennessee on the Governor of Missouri
for the three men, and I felt that success
was only delayed a day or two at most.</p>




<p class="center">CHAPTER VIII.
</p>

<blockquote><p><i>A determined Party of Horsemen.&mdash;The Outlaws surrounded
and the Birds caged.&mdash;A Parley.&mdash;An
affecting Scene.&mdash;The burning Cabin.&mdash;Its Occupants
finally surrender.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>While the telegrams were flying back and
forth on Tuesday, the twelfth, Cottrell
and Marriott were busily engaged. Early that
morning Mr. Stone came to Verona, and told
them that he had learned that Farrington and
cousins intended to leave Durham's for the Indian
Territory the next day. The news was
doubtless authentic, Stone having heard it from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Smothers, who had said that Farrington had told
him so himself. It was clearly impossible to wait
for William's arrival, as, by that time, the men
might be safely hidden in the wild country to the
westward. Instant action was absolutely necessary,
and Cottrell so informed Mr. Purdy, who
soon gathered a force of eight men. Very little
would have been needed to obtain even a larger
number of recruits, for, had Mr. Purdy and the
detectives publicly told the story of the men
whom they wished to capture, there would have
been plenty of eager volunteers, all anxious to
aid in ridding the country of such a band of outlaws.
It was not deemed advisable, however, to
summon a large posse, lest the news might
spread so fast as to reach the ears of the criminals
before the detectives could surround them;
on this account only a few reliable men were let
into the secret, and they left town singly and in
pairs to avoid observation, having a rendezvous
outside.</p>

<p>Just before starting, Mr. Purdy received a dispatch
from the general land agent, ordering him
to Pearce City instantly, as several purchasers of
land were awaiting him there; although he tried
to have his visit postponed one day, he was unsuccessful,
his orders being imperatively repeated
by telegraph, and so he was unable to accompany
the detectives and citizens on their expedition to
Durham's. The party of eight met the detectives
outside the town, and they were joined on
their way by three others, who lived on the road.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
They were all substantial business men or
farmers, but they were accustomed to a life in
the saddle, and they had all borne arms during
the war on one side or the other. In spite of
their present peaceful occupations they were not
a body who could be trifled with, and it was evident
that any gang of desperadoes would find
their match in these cool, determined, law-abiding
men.</p>

<p>A few miles from Verona they met a young
lady riding a large brown mule, but none of the
men in the party knew her. Cottrell felt sure,
however, that she was Durham's sister, and that
she was riding Farrington's mule. The descriptions
he had received of the girl from Stone and
Wisbey coincided exactly with her appearance,
while the mule could not be mistaken. He therefore
sent a man back to watch her, lest she
should have taken alarm at so large a cavalcade
of armed men. She rode on to Verona, however,
without showing any signs of uneasiness, and
the scout soon overtook the party.</p>

<p>On arriving one mile from Wisbey's, Marriott
went on to Stone's house with six men, while
Cottrell went to Wisbey's with the other five.
Stone and Wisbey soon gathered a number of
the neighbors, among whom was John Ellis, who
owned the house and land where the Durhams
were living; he was a very highly respected citizen,
and was not at all displeased at the idea of
getting rid of his semi-disreputable tenants. The
management of the affair was then unanimously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
voted to Cottrell, and the party rode rapidly
toward the Durham house. It was situated at
the edge of a clearing, with underbrush and
woodland close to it on three sides, so that great
caution was necessary, lest the villains should
see them approaching, and escape into the woods.
At a reasonable distance from the house, therefore,
the party divided, a part, under Marriott's
direction, dismounting and making their way to
the rear of the house on foot. When sufficient
time had elapsed to enable the latter party to
surround the house, Cottrell, with the remainder,
dashed up to the front of the house and spread
out, so as to make sure that no one should escape.
As they approached, a man, who proved to be
Jim Durham, appeared on the porch and asked
what they wanted; to which Cottrell replied that
he wanted the men in the house.</p>

<p>The words had hardly passed his lips ere Barton
sprang into the open doorway with a navy revolver
leveled at Cottrell; but, seeing that the latter, as
well as several others, had him covered, he shut
the door quickly and started for the back of the
house. By this time, however, the cordon of
guards had drawn close around, and, as he
emerged at the rear, he found himself confronted
by half a dozen determined men, who ordered
him to surrender. He then hastily tried to close
the back door also, and pointed his revolver
through the crack; but the discharge of several
shots, which struck close to him, caused him to
withdraw his pistol and tightly close the door. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
was evident that the birds were caged at last, and
it was now only a question of time when they
would be taken; as it was only one o'clock in the
afternoon, there were still four hours of daylight
to conduct the siege.</p>

<p>Jim Durham, when he saw the rifles and revolvers
of so large a force pointed at him, was thoroughly
frightened, and he begged piteously that
they would not shoot him. Cottrell placed his
men behind trees, fences, and other protections,
so as to be safe from any attempt to pick them off
by the men in the house, and yet to guard every
means of exit from the place; he then called Jim
Durham out and searched him, finding nothing
but a single-barreled pistol. He then sent Jim to
the door of the house to summon the men inside
to surrender, telling them that he was determined
to have them&mdash;alive if possible, but if not, dead.</p>

<p>They refused to surrender, saying that they
would kill any man who should approach the
house. When Durham brought back their answer,
Cottrell sent word that he would give them
five minutes in which to decide whether they
would yield peaceably or be burned out and shot
to death. Just then Mrs. Durham, the mother
of the Durham boys, begged Cottrell to allow
her to go speak to Farrington and Barton, as she
believed she could induce them to surrender.
Accordingly, she went to the front window and
implored them not to have the house burned
down, as all her household goods would be destroyed.
They replied that they might as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
die inside as to come out and be shot down. Cottrell
sent back word that they should be treated
like all other prisoners if they would pass out
their arms and surrender quietly; but if they
tried to fight or resist, they would surely be
killed.</p>

<p>As they still refused, Jim Durham was sent to
barricade the doors with fence rails, so that they
should not be able to rush out unexpectedly. He
whined and complained that the men inside would
shoot him, but he was obliged to go, and though
they did threaten him, he was able to crawl up
and lay the rails without getting within range.
The house was a solid log cabin, with only two
doors and very few windows, so that it was possible
to approach it in one or two directions without
exposure to a fire from within. When the
doors had been securely barricaded, Cottrell ordered
him to get on the roof, which was a common
shingle roof, and set fire to the house. Mrs.
Durham was carrying on at a great rate, first
begging Farrington to surrender, and then praying
to Cottrell not to burn her property. John
Ellis, to whom the house belonged, gave full permission
to burn it, and a fire was built in the
open air to make brands to set it afire.</p>

<p>Mrs. Durham was allowed to make one more
appeal to the ruffians inside, but they would not
listen to her entreaties. They asked her, however,
what kind of a looking man Cottrell was,
and what he wanted to arrest them for. Cottrell
was standing near enough to hear the question,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
and after Mrs. Durham had described his appearance,
he told them that he wanted them for an
express robbery; that he would treat them kindly
if they should yield peaceably; but if they should
refuse this, his last offer, he should set fire to the
house and shoot them down as they ran out. He
said he had no wish to kill them, but that he was
determined they should not escape; rather than
allow them to get away, he would have them
shot on sight; but they would be protected and
brought to trial if they would surrender.</p>

<p>To this they replied that they intended killing
some of their besiegers first, anyhow. Finding
further parley useless, therefore, Cottrell gave
the order to burn the building, and Durham was
forced to carry the embers and brands to burn
his own premises. Just at this time, the young
girl, whom they had met riding a mule toward
Verona, rode up to the house and asked what
was the matter. As Cottrell had surmised, this
was Miss Durham, and she was very much
frightened at what she saw.</p>

<p>The afternoon sun was buried in a deep bank
of clouds, so that the twilight was rapidly drawing
on, there being just enough light to show the
barricaded doors, the deserted porch, and the determined
men scattered around, with shot-guns
and rifles pointed at the low log cabin, above
which a frightened man stood out in bold relief
against the sky, tearing off the shingles and
piling them upon a glowing flame at his feet.
Everything was now hushed in deathly silence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a><br /><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>and it needed no explanation for any one to understand
that a bloody tragedy was about to occur
if that flame should be allowed to envelop the
building. It was now the prison of its two occupants,
but only a short time would elapse
before it would be their tomb.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <i>Burning out the Outlaws!</i>]</p>

<p>On seeing the situation, Miss Durham asked to
be allowed to speak to the men, as she said she
knew they would listen to her. On Cottrell's refusal
to hold any more parley with them, she
burst into tears, threw her arms around his neck,
and implored him to let her speak to Barton just
once, if only for five minutes. Finally, seeing
that most of his party wished to give the girl a
chance to speak to her sweetheart, Cottrell said
that she could have three minutes to obtain their
arms; if they surrendered immediately, the fire
should be put out; but, if they should still refuse,
their last chance of saving the house and their
lives would be gone. Miss Durham then went to
the window, and talked with the men in the most
imploring manner, urging them not to sacrifice
themselves, as they would surely do if they remained
in the burning house. Her entreaties did
not seem to affect them at first; and, as the
flames were then beginning to gather strength,
Cottrell ordered her to come away from the
house, and leave them to their fate. She made
one more appeal, and Barton handed her a navy
revolver; then Farrington did the same, and she
brought them to Cottrell, saying that they would
surrender if they could be sure that their lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
would be spared. Cottrell told her to go back
and get the rest of their arms, and assure them
that they should be taken to Tennessee for trial.
She soon returned with another revolver and a
shot-gun, and said that the men would come out.
Cottrell therefore removed the rails, opened the
front door, and called them out&mdash;Barton coming
first, and then Farrington. The latter proved to
be Hillary, not Levi, as he had called himself. It
was not known why he had used his brother's
name, but it was supposed that Hillary had taken
his name to enable him to prove an <i>alibi</i> in case
he should be arrested.</p>

<p>Cottrell's party first secured the prisoners with
ropes, and then assisted Jim Durham to extinguish
the fire on the roof; the latter was quite rotten,
and it had burned so slowly that very little damage
had been done. The prisoners were thoroughly
searched, but nothing of any consequence was
found upon them, the total of their funds being
less than three dollars. A prolonged search
through the house revealed nothing of importance,
except the fact that it was quite an arsenal for
arms, there being found six navy revolvers, two
double-barreled shot-guns, and a Spencer repeating
rifle. The siege had lasted nearly three hours,
and, another hour having been spent in searching
the house and saddling their animals, it was nearly
dark by the time they started for Verona. Farrington
and Barton were carefully tied upon the
horse and mule respectively, and, after thanking
the neighboring farmers for their assistance, Cot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>trell
took the road back, accompanied by the
eleven men who belonged in and about Verona.
The greatest care was taken that the prisoners
should have no opportunity for escape, and they
were informed that any attempt to get away
would be the signal for riddling them with bullets.</p>

<p>While riding along, Cottrell learned from Baton
that the party had been very lucky in finding
the two men in the house, since their usual custom
had been to spend the days in the woods,
coming in only at night to sleep. On this occasion,
however, the weather was so cold that they
were spending the day indoors.</p>

<p>When asked why they had not surrendered before,
they both made the same reply, namely:
that they believed the posse of citizens intended
either to shoot them immediately, or to hang
them after a trial by lynch law.</p>

<p>On arriving in Verona early in the evening, the
prisoners were securely tied up with ropes, and
Cottrell alternated during the night with Marriott
in watching them. A blacksmith was also called
up, and shortly after midnight he completed two
pair of leg shackles, with which they were fastened
together. My men were greatly fatigued,
having ridden a large number of miles every day
for a week, and the excitement of the affair
added, of course, to their prostration, but they
resolutely paced the floor in alternate four-hour
watches, determined that no possible loophole for
escape should again be afforded to such daring
villains as these two.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>The result of the expedition was, of course,
transmitted to me in telegraphic cipher at once;
but the arrest was kept secret for the time, in order
to prevent a knowledge of it coming to Levi
Farrington, who was still at large. According to
Barton, Levi was concealed somewhere in Tennessee,
but this statement was proof positive that
he was not in Tennessee at all, since Barton's object
in telling anything about him was evidently
intended to mislead us; hence, no faith was
put in his story, and other steps were taken to
capture Levi.</p>

<p>William arrived in Verona on the morning
after the fight, and he prepared to return with
the prisoners to St. Louis by the noon train. It
was supposed that Levi Farrington was also on
his way to the rendezvous at Durham's farm,
and that he would probably approach by the
direct road through Douglas County. Cottrell
and Marriott were left, therefore, to attend to
Levi and the old lady, whose whereabouts were
still uncertain. William saw most of the citizens
engaged in the affair, and heartily thanked
them for their aid; being questioned as to whether
they should receive the reward of one thousand
dollars offered by the express company for the
capture of the two Farringtons and Barton, he
informed them that he considered them entitled
to it, and that he should recommend its payment,
but that the matter would be decided by the officers
of the company. I may here anticipate
events somewhat to state that the company paid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
the citizens and farmers a liberal amount for their
services in capturing the robbers, and a settlement
was made which was satisfactory to all parties.</p>

<p>William left Verona about noon of the day he
arrived, taking Hillary Farrington and Barton
with him, under guard of Galway and Connell.
On arriving in St. Louis, he separated the prisoners
in order to induce Barton to confess; and,
after a long conversation, in which he showed
Barton how conclusive was the evidence against
all three of the men, he obtained a very full confession,
of which the greater part is here given
exactly as it was taken down from Barton's lips.</p>




<p class="center">CHAPTER IX.
</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Barton's Confession.&mdash;The Express Robberies and the
Outlaws' subsequent Experiences fully set forth therein.&mdash;A
Clue that had been suddenly dropped taken
up with so much Profit, that, after a desperate Struggle,
another Desperado is Captured.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>"I am twenty-two years of age," said Barton,
"and my native place was Columbus, Mississippi.
When quite young, I left home and
took to following the army. About five or six
years ago I moved to Normandy, Tennessee, and
lived with the family of Major Landis, and two
or three years later, I went to work on the Nash<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>ville
and Northwestern Railroad as a brakeman,
remaining as such over two years. About three
years since I formed the acquaintance of Hillary
and Levi Farrington, at Waverly, Tennessee.
These are the men otherwise known as J. H.
Clark and Edward J. Russell. Afterward I opened
a saloon in Nashville, and Levi Harrington visited
me there several times. Last April or May
he was arrested on suspicion of counterfeiting,
but as there was no case against him, he was discharged.
After a short time, I went down to visit
Levi at Mrs. Farrington's; she lived at the head
of Tumbling Run Creek, twelve miles back of Gillem
Station. Hillary was in jail at Memphis at
that time, charged with murder and horse-stealing.
When he got out of jail, Levi, Hillary, and
myself all made a trip to Little Rock, Arkansas,
gambling by throwing three-card monte, and
we won about thirteen hundred dollars; we then
returned to Gillem Station, where we remained
until the twenty-first of July, this year. During
this time, Levi, who frequently rode back and
forth on the express trains, spoke of the feasibility
of robbing them.</p>

<p>"On the morning of July 21, Levi, Hillary, and
myself left Gillem Station for the purpose of robbing
the express train at some of the stations
either on that road or on the Mobile and Ohio
Railroad. At Union City we changed cars, and
arrived at Moscow just after dark. The plan was,
that we all three should enter the car and overpower
the messenger; but Levi and Hillary were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
the only ones who entered. I remained on the
platform of the first passenger coach and kept
watch. When the train was passing the water
tank, they slacked up the speed, and we all
jumped off and struck for the woods. The messenger
had nothing whatever to do with this
robbery, so far as I was ever informed.</p>

<p>"As I said before, we struck into the woods
and reached the river just above Hickman, where
we stole a fisherman's skiff, and all three of us
started down the river. Finding that we were
pursued, we left the skiff on the Tennessee shore,
near Island Number Ten. We then took the
river road and walked back as far as Lester's
Landing, arriving there about dinner-time, July
23. Levi divided the money, giving me one-third
of one thousand dollars, which was all, he said,
in the safe, although I always believed there was
more.</p>

<p>"So far as I know, neither of the Farringtons
had ever met Lester before, and I am sure that I
had never set eyes on him until we went to his
place at this time. On account of the spot being
so lonely and isolated, Hillary proposed that we
put up a store there, as it would be a good cover
for our actual business. We started the store,
and applied to the postmaster to establish a post-office,
to be known as Lester's Landing; our object
in this move was, of course, to give an added
color of respectability and <i>bona fide</i> business to
our transactions. From this time until the middle
of October, I remained at the store nearly all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
the time; Hillary was also there most of the time,
but Levi very seldom. During one of the latter's
western trips, he said he had been out to see his
Aunt Durham.</p>

<p>"Along in October, Levi proposed that we
again strike the express company when the train
stopped for supper at Union City. Hillary had
been in the habit of riding back and forth on the
engine, and he understood how to run a train.
Levi suggested that we take a man named Bill
Taylor into the robbery with us; he was then
employed chopping wood for Lester, and when
Levi approached him on the subject he agreed to
go. Levi left Lester's a few days before the robbery.
Hillary and I did not leave until the nineteenth,
when we went up to Columbus by steamer,
taking along a large quantity of fish. Having
sold our fish, we took the train for Union City,
where we arrived the same evening. On getting
off the train, we met Levi and Bill Taylor on the
platform, and the only conversation which took
place was when Levi asked why we had not arrived sooner,
to which we replied that we came
as soon as we could. The next morning we met
again, having slept in separate places so as not to
attract attention, and went down the road some
distance toward Hickman. While camped in the
woods that evening, about ten o'clock, an old
man named Hicks came along with a bottle of
whisky and stopped at our camp-fire quite a
time. There were present Hillary, Levi, myself,
and Bill Taylor. We remained in the woods all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
that night. The next day we moved further into
the woods toward Hickman, and at night, just at
dark, we came back to Union City.</p>

<p>"We had been there only a few minutes when
the up train came along; she stopped and backed
down a little ways, when all the train hands left
her and went to supper. Hillary and Taylor
then boarded the engine, and Levi and myself
jumped aboard the express car. The messenger
was eating his supper when we went in, and,
seeing Levi point a Derringer at him, he exclaimed:
'Don't shoot me! I will surrender.'
Levi compelled him to unlock the safe, and we
took all the money. Levi then swung the messenger's
lantern, and the train stopped, when we
all jumped off and started down the railroad to
Hickman. Our intention was to go to the wood-yard
near Union City, and steal a ride on a freight
train to Hickman. We hid under the platform
at the wood-yard, and while there Levi accidentally
shot himself in the thigh; but the wound
was very slight, and it hardly interfered with his
walking. As the freight train did not stop, we
were obliged to walk to Hickman, where we arrived
Sunday night. We had had some provisions
when we first camped out, which Bill Taylor
had carried in a valise; but he had left the
valise and all its contents on the engine, so that
we had very little to eat.</p>

<p>"While in the woods we divided the money,
but Levi, who carried it, showed up only twenty
three hundred dollars.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sunday night we stole a skiff in Hickman
and went down the river to James' Bayou, and
while there, on Monday morning, we saw Messenger
Cross, whose car had been robbed, making
inquiries about us in a grocery-store. We then
started off on foot, going down the river on the
Missouri shore. About a mile below James'
Bayou we found the skiff which we had previously
set adrift, and which had evidently been picked
up by some one. Taking this skiff again, Hillary,
Taylor, and I dropped down to a point about a mile
above Lester's, leaving Levi on the Missouri shore,
where we started from. We landed on the Tennessee
shore, and walked down the river road a
short distance, when Taylor left us, remaining in
the woods. Hillary and I met Lester on the
road soon afterward, and told him that we had
come down on a steamboat which was then tied
up, on account of the heavy fog. Levi arrived
next day, having come across the river with a
fisherman.</p>

<p>"The following Sunday, October 29, Hillary
left on a steamboat, taking with him a woman
named Slaughter, with whom he said he was going
to Davidson's wood-yard, nine miles above
Cape Girardeau. He expected to return in a few
days.</p>

<p>"The next thing of any importance which occurred
was on the Tuesday night following, when
Messrs. Pinkerton and Connell rode up to Lester's
house. At the first glance, I thought they were
officers, and Levi told me that he thought the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
same. I saw him pull his pistol out of his
pocket before getting out of his chair."</p>

<p>[The moment Connell opened the door, Levi
knew that he was a detective, having seen him
acting in that capacity in Memphis, when Hillary
was arrested for horse-stealing the previous
spring.]</p>

<p>"When I made my escape from Lester's house,"
continued Barton, "I ran right back through the
cornfield; I heard all the shooting, but did not
see it. In a short time Levi joined me in the
cane-brake back of the cornfield. Levi told me
that he had had a shooting match with the two
officers, but he did not know whether he had hit
either of them or not; they had not hit him, but
he had had a very narrow escape.</p>

<p>"After awhile we slipped up to the house, and
saw that the officers were gone; so we went in,
got our supper, and took our pistols, besides a
shawl and blanket. We then got an old skiff,
crossed the river, and slept in the woods on the
Missouri shore. The next day we remained under
cover until nightfall, when we recrossed the river,
and went through the woods to Union City,
spending Wednesday night and Thursday in the
woods on the way. On Thursday night we took
the train from Union City to Gillem Station. The
conductor of the train was Conductor Roberts, on
whose run I had formerly been brakeman; and,
being afraid he might recognize me, I laid down
in my seat and covered up my face, while Levi
paid both fares. We arrived at Gillem Station<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
about three o'clock in the morning, and reached
Mrs. Farrington's house about daylight.</p>

<p>"I gave Mrs. Farrington five hundred and fifty
dollars in money to keep for me, this amount
being the proceeds of both express robberies, and
she still has it in her possession. Before leaving
Lester's, Hillary had given most of his money to
Levi to take to their mother to keep for him, and
Levi left with her nearly the whole of his share of
the plunder also.</p>

<p>"We had been at Mrs. Farrington's a week
when Hillary arrived. Before this, we all thought
that the officers had captured him, and we were
quite surprised to see him safe. He said that
Detective Connell had arrested him at Mrs. Gully's,
and that he had made his escape by jumping out
of Connell's wagon into a thicket near Allenville;
he had then gone right back to the house where
he had left Mrs. Slaughter, where he got a pistol
and some money, and had his irons removed.</p>

<p>"At the time Hillary arrived at Mrs. Farrington's,
the old lady had been gone a day and a night
on her way to Texas or Missouri. It was understood
that Levi and I were to meet her somewhere
on the road, or at Holton's farm, near the
line between Lawrence and Dade Counties, Missouri.
The day after Hillary arrived, we started
for Missouri; I was riding a sorrel horse; Hillary,
a chestnut-sorrel horse; and Levi, a large brown
mule. We spent two days at the house of Mr.
Douglas, near Mrs. Farrington's, and then crossed
the Tennessee River at Cuba. We crossed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Mississippi River by the last ferryboat on Friday
evening, November 10, at Hall's Ferry, opposite
Point Pleasant, Missouri. We saw no men on
guard at the ferries. We struck right out through
Nigger-Wool Swamp to Bloomfield, where Levi
left us. He said he was going to Farmington,
Illinois, as that was a good place to keep under
cover. After he left us, nothing important occurred
until our arrest. We knew where Mrs.
Farrington was every night, and also knew all
about the two men who were following her; we
did not mind letting them follow her, as they
could not have captured us, and we could have
shaken them off at any time if we had wanted to
do so.</p>

<p>"Levi and Hillary frequently spoke of making
other raids upon the express company, and said
what a soft thing it was. It was my intention to
separate from them as soon as I could get my
money from the old lady, as I wished to return to
my friends below Columbus, Mississippi.</p>

<p>"The foregoing is all I know of the Farringtons
or the express robberies.</p>

<p>
(Signed), "<span class="smcap">William Barton.</span>"<br />
</p>

<p>It will be observed how completely this confession
corroborated our investigations, there being
few new points learned. The information that
Mrs. Farrington had possession of nearly all the
stolen money was valuable, and I sent instructions
to Cottrell, at once, to attach all of her
property in the name of the Southern Express<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
Company, if it could be done. But the most important
feature brought out was the hiding-place
of Levi Farrington, which was given as
Farmington, Illinois. It will be remembered that
William found, at the store at Lester's Landing,
some pieces of paper, upon which was scribbled,
"Kate Graham, Farmington, Illinois;" that I
sent a detective to that place to see Mrs. Graham;
that the latter answered, with every evidence of
truthfulness, that she did not know Russell,
Clark, or Barton; and that the clue was dropped
immediately. From Barton, however, William
learned that Mrs. Kate Graham was a cousin of
the Farringtons, and that, being a highly respectable
and conscientious woman, she knew nothing
of their <i>aliases</i>, nor of their crimes. It was there
that Levi Farrington had gone to hide. Barton's
confession was made on the fourteenth, and
William instantly sent me a cipher dispatch containing
the important features of it. By the
evening train of that day, my other son, Robert
A. Pinkerton, took passage for Farmington, accompanied
by Detective W. T. Brown, of my
force. They arrived there about noon the next
day, and soon learned that Levi Farrington was
staying with his relatives. Having presented
letters of introduction to one or two influential
men, Robert obtained an introduction to the
city marshal, who promised to give all the aid in
his power to arrest Farrington.</p>

<p>About two o'clock they saw the latter coming
down the street, and, by previous arrangement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
Robert allowed Levi to pass him, both walking
toward Brown and the marshal. Levi Farrington
was a very powerful man, standing six feet
in his stockings, with a frame and muscles in
proportion to his size. Remembering the desperate
character of the man, Robert did not deem it
advisable to give him any chance to draw a
weapon or show fight; he therefore followed
Farrington closely until he was about ten feet
from the marshal, and then, springing at him,
he pinioned the desperado's arms by clasping him
tightly around the body just at the elbows.
Farrington did not stop to question the cause of
this proceeding&mdash;he knew the reason of his seizure
well enough&mdash;but, gathering his whole
strength, he made one jump away from the
two officers who were approaching in front, and
landed nearly in the middle of the street, taking
Robert along with him. Robert clung to him
like a vise, however, and before he could make
another such an effort, the other two were upon
him. A terrible struggle now ensued in the
street, during which both Robert and Brown were
badly bruised by being rolled upon and kicked by
their powerful prisoner. Robert knew that Farrington
was desperate enough to fight to the
bitter end, and that he would kill as many as he
could before being killed himself; to release his
arms, therefore, would enable him to draw a
weapon, as he was undoubtedly well armed, hence
Robert never relaxed his hold. Having a professional
pride in securing his prisoner alive, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>over,
he did not wish to resort to extreme measures
except to save the lives of other persons, and, as
a large crowd had gathered around the moment
the struggle began, there would have been evident
danger in allowing him an instant's freedom.
Over and over they rolled together, therefore,
Farrington striving with all his strength to break
Robert's clasp upon his arms, while the other two
officers were doing their best to pinion his legs.
After a ten minutes' struggle, they succeeded at
length in holding him down and sitting upon his
legs until he could be tied with ropes. By this
time, the whole party were pretty thoroughly
exhausted, but, after resting a few minutes to
recover their breath, the officers got handcuffs on
their prisoner's wrists, and took him to the railroad
station, where he was searched. Little
money was found on his person, but he had a large
revolver, two Derringer pistols, and a large dirk
concealed about him. He was then placed in the
freight office, while Brown and Mr. Graham, Mrs.
Kate Graham's husband, went to the latter's
house to get Levi's baggage. On their return,
the whole party took passage for Chicago, where
they did not arrive until next day, owing to the
failure to make connections. In Levi's valise
were found two revolvers, some jewelry, and a
very large sum of money.</p>

<p>They arrived so late on Saturday that there
was no train for Cairo before the following evening,
and meantime the prisoner required the
most careful watching, as none of our handcuffs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
were large enough to fit his wrists without cutting
into the flesh. Robert and Brown were completely
prostrated by the strain upon their muscles
and the injuries they had received, so that they
felt the effects of the struggle for several days.</p>

<p>The moment that Robert arrived in Chicago
with his prisoner, the latter was taken to the
First Precinct police station, where he was placed
in a cell for safe keeping. During the afternoon
it was learned that he had sent for a lawyer to
obtain a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i>. The arrest had
been made without any warrant, and no requisition
had been obtained for use in Illinois, as I had
expected to capture all three of the men in Missouri.
Should Farrington succeed in getting the
desired writ, I should be forced to give up my
hold upon him, and, before the requisition of the
Governor of Tennessee upon the Governor of Illinois
could be received, he would be probably
beyond the reach of pursuit.</p>

<p>I therefore procured a closed vehicle and took
the prisoner out for a drive, carefully bound, with
two reliable men as guards. The afternoon was
thus spent, and, after dark, there being no longer
any object in driving around the suburbs of the
city, Farrington was taken to my office and kept
all night. He behaved very well, and did not
seem anxious to get away by force. He tried,
however, to induce Robert to let him go, telling
him that it would be worth a very large amount
of money to him to do so. Finding his offers disregarded,
he appeared to take his arrest very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
coolly, saying that he guessed he had money
enough to see him through.</p>

<p>On Sunday evening, Robert and Brown took
him to the railroad station, and the party embarked
for Cairo.</p>




<p class="center">CHAPTER X.
</p>

<blockquote><p><i>A terrible Struggle for Life or Death upon the Transfer-boat
"Illinois."&mdash;"Overboard!"&mdash;One less Desperado.&mdash;The
Fourth and Last Robber taken.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>After Barton had made his confession
to William in St. Louis, the prisoners,
Hillary Farrington and Barton, were kept separate,
as the latter was afraid that Hillary would find
some means of killing him. About midnight of
Thursday, December fourteenth, they all took
passage by railroad for Cairo, and there they immediately
went on board the large transfer-boat
to Columbus, Kentucky. All the detectives were
thoroughly worn out from excitement and loss of
sleep, but they did not for an instant relax their
vigilant watch upon their prisoners. William
had been talking for some time with Hillary,
trying to obtain a confession and to learn what
had been done with the money secured at the two
robberies. From the questions that William
asked, Hillary soon learned, or surmised, that
Barton had confessed. He was terribly enraged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
at this, and without doubt he would have killed
Barton if he could have got at him; but being
unable to do so, his fury was all turned upon his
captors.</p>

<p>My son hoped by threatening to have Mrs.
Farrington arrested and imprisoned, to induce
Hillary to give up his share of the plunder rather
than have his mother punished. This threat
seemed to infuriate him beyond anything, and he
swore that he would have his revenge on William
if he had to wait twenty years for it. After sitting
sullenly thinking on the subject for a time, he
said he was cold, and wanted to get a drink.
William therefore offered to go with him into the
bar-room, and they walked toward the forward
end of the saloon, leaving Galway and Barton
seated together. Connell had gone into the
water-closet a few moments before, but, as there
was a detective with each of the prisoners, no
attempt at escape was anticipated.</p>

<p>The steamer was the powerfully-built transfer-boat
"Illinois," and she was running with great
speed, her ponderous wheels revolving at an unusually
rapid rate. The bar-room was situated
just forward of the saloon, after passing through
the barber shop, and it could be entered from the
saloon or through a door leading upon the guards,
just forward of the paddle-box.</p>

<p>As they were about to enter the barber shop
from the saloon, Hillary drew back, saying that
he did not want to go that way, as there were
some men in that room whom he knew. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
therefore went out upon the guards to walk along
to the outer door of the bar-room. The space
was narrow, and the rail quite low, so that it
would not have been at all difficult for a man to
spring overboard, even though he were in irons.
This idea occurred to William, but he did not
trouble himself about it, since he knew that the
heavy strokes of the paddle-wheel would instantly
kill any one who might attempt such a thing.
William wore a loose-fitting sack coat with large
pockets, in one of which he carried a heavy army
revolver, which he had taken from Hillary, his
own revolver being in his belt. In walking it
was his habit to put his hand on the butt of this
army revolver, which protruded somewhat from
the pocket. On reaching the door, however, he
took his right hand from the pistol to turn the
knob. This was a careless action, of which he
never would have been guilty, had he been less
fatigued, mentally and physically, but, being so
used up as to act almost mechanically, his habitual
thoughtfulness was momentarily absent, and
he was caught off his guard for an instant in a
manner which nearly cost him his life. It should
be understood that the scene which ensued occurred
so rapidly as to occupy less time in its
passage than is required to read about it, and that
during those few seconds a struggle of life and
death was going on.</p>

<p>Hardly had William's hand touched the doorknob
ere he felt the pistol drawn out of his coat
pocket. He knew there was but one person who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
could have done it, and that person was a perfect
devil thirsting for his blood. Turning like a
flash, he seized Farrington by both wrists, just as
the latter was trying to cock the pistol; then
there was a terrible contest. The pistol was in
Farrington's hands, which were held so close together
by the irons as to make it impossible to
wrench one away from the other; it was pointed
directly at William's head, and should Farrington
succeed in cocking it, William's death would
be instantaneous. All his energies, therefore,
were directed toward keeping Farrington's hands
far enough apart to prevent him from drawing
back the hammer. The space was too narrow to
permit of such a struggle without one party or
the other being forced back upon the rail, and, in
a moment, William had lifted his lighter antagonist
from the deck, pressing him against the railing,
and at the same time shouting for assistance.
In response to his call, Connell came running out
in <i>dishabille</i>, with his pistol in one hand and his
pantaloons in the other. At this moment the
cold muzzle of the pistol was pressed against
William's temple, and he heard the click of the
hammer as his desperate prisoner succeeded in
drawing it back. He made a violent plunge forward,
ducking his head as he did so, and simultaneously
the pistol exploded close to his ear, the
ball ploughing a little furrow in the scalp, while the
powder scorched his neck and hair. Staggering
back stunned and dizzy for a moment, he was
caught by Connell, who asked whether he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
much hurt. He soon gathered his senses, and,
finding his wound to be only trifling, he asked
what had become of Farrington. Connell pointed
overboard, and no further answer was necessary;
no man dropping in front of those wheels could
have lived for an instant, and, even had he not
been struck, he could not have kept himself up in
the rapid current then running filled with fine ice.</p>

<p>By this time the bar-room, barber shop, and saloon
had been emptied of their occupants, and
the boat had been stopped to see whether the man
could be picked up; but, as this was clearly hopeless,
the trip was soon resumed. Connell's arrival
had been most opportune for William, since he
had caught the weapon the moment it was discharged,
and succeeded in changing the course of
the bullet sufficiently to save William's life.
Thinking, however, that William had been killed,
Connell had struck Farrington on the head with
his pistol almost simultaneously with the explosion,
and the blow, aided by the plunge which
William made forward in endeavoring to dodge
the pistol-shot, had sent Farrington over the rail
into the water, where he was undoubtedly killed
the next instant by the paddle-wheels.</p>

<p>The fact of the man's death was so absolutely
certain that no person could doubt it, if acquainted
with the circumstances; yet there were not wanting
people who insinuated that he had been
allowed to escape by jumping overboard and
swimming ashore. The absurdity of such a story
is manifest, for, even supposing that his irons had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
been removed, and that he had escaped injury
from the paddle-wheels, he never could have
swam ashore at the spot where the affair occurred.
The nearest point of the river bank was more than
three hundred yards away, and the current at that
place was running off the shore; besides, the
night was very cold, and the water was covered
with a film of ice, so that after five minutes' immersion
in it, a man would have become wholly
numbed and insensible.</p>

<p>Barton was not at all surprised when he heard
of Hillary Farrington's death, for he said that he
knew Hillary so well that he had expected
nothing else from the time he was taken; he was
so desperate that his intention undoubtedly had
been to have seized William and dragged him
overboard; but, seeing the pistol, another idea
had probably occurred to him. Barton said that
had Hillary succeeded in killing William, he would
have gone up to the pilot-house with the revolver,
and forced the pilot to land him immediately;
once on shore, his knowledge of the country
would have enabled him to escape again. Whatever
had been his plans, however, he had failed
in his attempt at murder, and had paid the
penalty of his rashness with his life.</p>

<p>The rest of the party went on to Columbus,
where they took passage for Union City, arriving
there Friday morning.</p>

<p>About this time, Mr. Ball, who had been sent
to follow the wagon train of Mrs. Farrington, reported,
after a silence of several days, that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
traced her into the Indian Territory. In point of
fact, she was settled at Ash Grove, near Mount
Vernon, in Greene County, Missouri, and had
been there ever since Hillary and Barton had left
her before their arrest at Durham's. It will thus
be seen how fortunate it was that I had not
trusted to Ball and Bledsoe to keep track of Mrs.
Farrington, since they had utterly lost the trail,
and had followed another set of wagons for several
days as far as the Indian Territory; when,
probably suspecting that he had made a mistake,
Ball telegraphed to the express company's officers
for instructions. He was then ordered to return at
once with Bledsoe, the whole party having been
captured by that time.</p>

<p>While speaking of Mrs. Farrington, I may as
well give an account of all our dealings with her,
irrespective of the chronological order of the
story:</p>

<p>Having received Barton's order upon her for all
of the wagons and stock, and for five hundred
and fifty dollars in money, Cottrell endeavored to
attach her property in a civil suit. She insisted
that she had none of Barton's money&mdash;indeed,
that she had no money at all&mdash;and she refused to
give up anything. At last, finding that he could
not legally attach her property, Cottrell took the
bold step of arresting her for receiving stolen
goods. She was taken to Mount Vernon, where
she engaged a lawyer to defend her, and then, of
course, Cottrell was also obliged to employ a legal
adviser. At length, a compromise was effected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
by which Mrs. Farrington was allowed to retain
a small portion of the property; Cottrell then
took possession of the remainder as agent of the
express company, and Mrs. Farrington was discharged
from custody. After selling some of the
animals, Cottrell shipped all the remaining chattels
to St. Louis, where the agent of the express
company took charge of them. The two detectives
then returned to Chicago, and no further
attention was paid to Mrs. Farrington.</p>

<p>On Saturday, after the arrival of William's
party, with Barton, in Union City, Detectives
Galway and Connell started out to arrest Bill
Taylor, the fourth one of the party of robbers.</p>

<p>This man was a long, lank, round-shouldered
fellow, with putty face, long, straggling hair and
beard, and a vacant expression of countenance,
who lived by hunting and chopping wood, below
Lester's Landing, in the vicinity of Reel's Foot
Lake. William had been satisfied of his complicity
in the robbery for some time previous to
the arrest of the others, but he had not arrested
him for the reason that he was sure of picking
him up whenever he wished to do so; and, knowing
Taylor to have been merely a weak accomplice,
he was anxious to secure the leaders in the
crime first. Barton's confession made the suspicion
of Taylor's guilt a certainty, and so Galway
and Connell were sent to arrest him.</p>

<p>At Mr. Merrick's they obtained a good guide,
and four other citizens joined them, so that they
had quite a formidable party. After visiting sev<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>eral
houses in the cane-brake, they learned where
Taylor was staying, and, on going there, they
saw him looking at them from a front window.
Galway asked Taylor to come down a few minutes
to give them some information, and Taylor
unsuspectingly complied. He had been allowed
to go free so long, and had so often talked with
William and others about the robbery, that he
did not imagine their object on this occasion.
On coming into the yard, therefore, he greeted
the men cordially, supposing them to be a party
scouting for the other robbers, of whose arrest he
had not heard. When he saw a couple of navy
revolvers close to his head, and heard an order to
throw up his hands, he surrendered without a
word. He was evidently badly frightened, but
he would not confess having had any part in the
robbery, and he refused to tell where his share of
the money was concealed. He was placed on
Connell's horse and taken to Merrick's, where
another horse was obtained, and the party went
on to Hickman; thence he was taken by wagon
to Union City, arriving there about midnight of
Saturday. Both Barton and Taylor were placed
in rooms in the hotel, where they were carefully
watched night and day by my detectives, the
county jail being almost useless as a place for
keeping prisoners.</p>

<p>On learning that the whole party had been arrested,
Taylor made a very full confession of all
the circumstances connected with the robbery,
and the movements of the robbers after it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
occurred. He confirmed Barton's account in every
particular, but revealed nothing new of any importance.
His share of the stolen money had
been only about one hundred and fifty dollars,
as Levi had made him believe that they had obtained
only six hundred dollars in all. About
fifty dollars were found on Taylor's person; the
rest he had spent. He said that Levi Farrington
had hidden all the checks, drafts, and unnegotiable
paper underneath an old log in the woods,
but that he could not tell where the log was, nor
find it, since it was not marked in any way, nor
had they taken any bearings by which to remember
it. He gave an account of the evening when
Hicks, the tipsy planter, came to their camp-fire,
which agreed exactly with the previous statements
of Hicks and Barton; but one slight remark
in his confession seemed to account for the
fifth man mentioned by Hicks. Taylor said
that during most of the time Hicks was at their
camp, one or two of the party were lying on the
ground with their feet toward the fire, and that
there was a log of wood lying beside them.
Now, it is probable that Hicks was just drunk
enough to be unable to tell the difference between
a man and a log, especially as, in his description
of the men, he gave the appearance of
Hillary Farrington twice as belonging to different
persons. Hicks's vision was somewhat uncertain
that night, evidently.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>




<p class="center">CHAPTER XI.
</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The last Scene in the Drama approaching.&mdash;A new Character
appears.&mdash;The Citizens of Union City suddenly
seem to have important business on hand.&mdash;The
Vigilantes and their Work.&mdash;Their Bullets and Judge
Lynch administer a quietus to Levi Farrington and
David Towler.&mdash;The End.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>The last scene in this drama seemed about to
end in the complete defeat of the whole
gang of villains and the triumph of law and justice,
when a new character came upon the stage,
and the curtain fell upon a bloody tragedy. That
substantial justice was done cannot be denied,
though the manner of its execution was beyond
and outside all forms of law. It was a striking
instance of the manner in which an outraged
community, particularly in the West and South,
will arrive at a satisfactory settlement of important
questions without the intervention of courts,
juries, or lawyers. The court of Judge Lynch
makes mistakes occasionally, but it rarely admits
of an appeal from its decision.</p>

<p>Robert arrived in Union City with Levi Farrington
on Monday, December eighteenth, and
he took his prisoner to the hotel for safe keeping,
with the others. They were kept in separate
rooms, and a detective remained with each of
them constantly. William spent several hours
with Levi Farrington, trying to induce him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
tell where he had hidden the stolen papers, and
also what he had done with his share of the
money, of which he had undoubtedly retained
the greater part. Finally he agreed to return all
the papers, and about twenty-five hundred dollars
besides, on condition that he should receive a
sentence of only five years in the penitentiary on
entering a plea of guilty. Having agreed to this
arrangement, William went to his room, which
was a large one, with several beds, occupied by
Robert, Brown, and Connell. As the men of my
force were all pretty well used up, Taylor and
Barton were placed in the same room, with Galway
guarding them, while Farrington, being
such a desperate fellow, was put in another
room, with three of the Union City policemen as
guards.</p>

<p>Soon after the arrival of Robert with Levi Farrington,
a man, named David Towler, tried to
get admission to Farrington's room. On being
denied, he was very insolent, and he insisted on
seeing Farrington alone. Finding that this would
not be permitted, he went away cursing the
officers and swearing to be revenged. His actions
naturally attracted the attention of the police,
and caused him to be regarded with a great deal
of suspicion, as a probable member of the Farrington
party of robbers. About eleven o'clock
that night, a policeman, named Benjamin Kline,
discovered this man Towler with a drawn revolver,
skulking behind a car standing on the side
track near the dépôt. He immediately called for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the railroad company's night watchman, and the
two approached the thief to arrest him. The
man instantly shot Kline through the lungs, and
then shot Moran, the watchman. Kline's wound
was mortal, and he died in a few minutes, while
Moran was supposed to be fatally hurt also. The
pistol-shots quickly drew a crowd, and a few
determined men gave chase to the murderer.
After quite a long pursuit he was captured, and
brought back to the station where Kline had just
died. A justice of the peace held a preliminary
examination at once, and the prisoner, David
Towler, was held for murder, without bail. He
was known to be a low, desperate fellow, who
had been imprisoned for horse-stealing and other
kindred crimes, until he was regarded almost as
an outlaw. He had long lived near Reel's Foot
Lake, and while there he had become acquainted
with the Farringtons. That their friendship was
more than that of two casual acquaintances was
shown by an important circumstance discovered
by William. It will be remembered that when
Levi Farrington stopped in Cairo to send eight
hundred dollars to his mother, he purchased two
of the largest-sized Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers.
They were exact fac-similes of each other, and
were numbered 1,278 and 1,279 respectively. At
the time of Levi's arrest, only one of these revolvers
was found, and he said that he had given
away the other to a friend, retaining number
1,279 himself. When Towler was captured,
William happened to notice that his revolver was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
similar to the one Levi had carried. This would
have been nothing to be remarked under ordinary
circumstances, since there were, undoubtedly,
many of these revolvers in use, all exactly alike
except in number; but William connected this
man Towler's appearance in Union City with the
arrival of the express robbers, and the new revolver
caught his eye at once. On closely examining
it, his suspicions were fully confirmed: <i>it was
numbered</i> 1,278, and was, without question, the
mate to Levi's, bought by him in Cairo and given
to Towler.</p>

<p>When this news became known to the throng
of citizens whom the shooting of Kline and Moran
had drawn together, the feeling against all the
prisoners became intense, and when Towler was
committed by the justice to the guard of the men
who were watching Levi, the citizens began to
depart very suddenly, as if they either had important
business elsewhere, or were in a hurry to
get home. By midnight the town was quiet, and
after a visit to the guards, to caution them to be
extra vigilant, William and Robert retired to their
room, together with Brown and Connell.</p>

<p>Young Kline, whom Towler had murdered, was
very highly esteemed in Union City, and his death
at the hands of an outlaw would have aroused
deep indignation at any time; but just now there
were additional reasons why the affair should excite
a desire for summary vengeance upon his
assassin. It had been shown that Towler must
have formerly been on intimate terms with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Farringtons, and these latter were well known as
desperadoes, whose hand was turned against every
man; hence, the crimes of the whole party were
considered as a sort of partnership affair, for
which each member of the firm was individually
liable. But, besides the natural indignation of
the law-abiding citizens for the crimes committed
by these men, there was a widespread sense of
insecurity so long as they were in that vicinity.
Towler had remarked, when captured, that he
would soon be out again, and all the prisoners
bore themselves with an air of bravado, as if they
had no fear nor expectation of punishment. It
was believed that a number of friends of the gang
among the desperadoes living in Nigger-Wool
Swamp and near Reel's Foot Lake intended to attempt
the rescue of the whole party of express
robbers, before they could be consigned to a secure
place of confinement. The citizens who had
risked their lives to capture Towler and the others,
who had turned out in time to see poor Kline die
in agony, were determined that nothing should
occur to prevent justice from reaching the criminals,
and exacting the fullest penalty for their
numerous crimes; hence the sudden departure of
the throng who had attended Towler's preliminary
examination before the justice. They did not go
to their homes, but gathered in a secluded place,
and formed a Committee of Safety. The question
as to what course would best protect the lives
and property of the community was then discussed,
and a conclusion was soon reached, without
a dissenting voice.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>Throughout the town all was hushed in the
usual stillness of a winter's night; no lights were
burning anywhere, save in an occasional sick-chamber,
and sleep seemed to have fallen alike
upon the just and unjust. In one room of the
hotel were Barton and Taylor, guarded by Galway
and an employé of the express company, while
near by was the room where Levi Farrington
and David Towler were watched by three of the
city policemen. A dim light burned in each room,
and, while the guards paced the floor in their
stocking feet, the prisoners lay on their beds in
deep slumber. Not a memory of the past, full as
it was of scenes of crime and blood, came to break
their repose; not a thought of the future, with
its possibilities of punishment, caused them to
lose one moment of their customary rest. Fear
they had never known; remorse was long since
forgotten; unconscious or careless of their impending
doom, they slept the night away.</p>

<p>About two o'clock there was a stealthy gathering
of masked men at the door of the hotel, and,
at a given signal from the leader, a certain number
slipped upstairs with little noise, and filled the
corridor from which the prisoners' rooms opened.
So sudden was their appearance and so quiet their
approach that even the wakeful guards scarce
heard them until the doors were forced open.
Then the policy of silence was dropped, and a
rush upon the guards was made. A battery of
pistols suddenly confronted them, and, as resistance
was clearly impossible, an unconditional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
surrender was at once made. The bursting in of
the doors awakened William and Robert, who
hastily sprang up, and, without stopping to put
on any clothing, opened their door, pistol in hand.
This move, however, had been anticipated by the
vigilantes, and a dozen or more pistols were thrust
in their faces as they appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p>"Go back, Pinkerton, we don't want to hurt
you," said one of the men outside, and they were
pushed back into the room, while the door was
hastily closed in their faces.</p>

<p>To resist such a body with the few men at his
command, William knew, would be suicidal, and
he did not especially care to sacrifice himself in
the interest of such a villainous band as those
whom the vigilantes were seeking. The four detectives,
therefore, dressed themselves and remained
in their room awaiting further developments.</p>

<p>Having overpowered the guards, the leader of
the vigilantes ordered the removal of Towler, and,
as the latter was hustled out of the door, Levi
Farrington knew that his hour had come. Standing
up and facing the remainder of the crowd,
who had withdrawn to the further side of the
room, he defied them all, and told them to fire
away. A volley of pistol-shots was the reply to
his words, and a rattling fire continued for two
or three minutes; when it ceased, Levi Farrington
was no more, his body having been struck by
more than thirty balls, almost any one of which
would have been instantaneously fatal. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a><br /><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>body was left where it fell, and the room was
soon deserted as the party hastened after the detachment
which had Towler in charge. The
whole affair was over in ten minutes, and when
the detectives again left their room none of the
masked party were to be seen. Levi Farrington's
body was found in his room, but no trace of
Towler could be discovered. Finding that the
excitement was over, the detectives returned to
bed, leaving Barton and Taylor still carefully
guarded. The former had slept through the confusion
and noise without even a start or restless
movement, but Taylor was terribly frightened,
and he fully expected to be lynched also.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "<i>The work of the Vigilante's.</i>"&mdash;<i>Page</i>&mdash;]</p>

<p>The next morning at breakfast, William was
informed that the body of Towler had been found
hanging to a tree near the graveyard, and, on
going to the spot, they found him as represented.
At the coroner's inquest little testimony could be
obtained further than that one man had been shot
to death and the other hung by parties unknown,
and the verdict was rendered accordingly. There
was naturally considerable excitement over the
affair for two or three days, but the general verdict
was, "Served 'em right." However violent
had been their taking off, there were few who
did not feel that society demanded their death,
not only as a punishment for their past crimes,
but as a means of security in the future. Believing
that a sentence to the penitentiary was
wholly inadequate, and that their escape therefrom
was not only possible, but probable, the cit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>izens
preferred to take no risks of future robberies
and murders by these desperadoes, and
they therefore took the most effectual method of
preventing their occurrence. Their action was
illegal, it is true, but then it was just&mdash;which is a
more important consideration sometimes.</p>

<p>On the following Friday, Barton and Taylor
had their preliminary hearing before a justice,
when they waived examination, and were committed
for trial in default of bail in the sum of
ten thousand dollars each. Upon the representation
to the justice that the county jail was an
unsafe place to confine the prisoners, permission
was obtained to remove them to the jail in Memphis;
the proper papers were made out, and the
transfer was made under William's management.</p>

<p>The death of Levi Farrington made the recovery
of the missing checks, papers, and money an impossibility,
since neither Barton nor Taylor were
able to conduct the officers to the place where
they were hidden. Barton gave the company a
bill of sale of the goods in the store at Lester's
Landing, however, and an assignment of all debts
due the firm, from which about five or six hundred
dollars were eventually realized. Robert
and Brown attended to this matter and returned
to Chicago. William was on duty until the two
remaining prisoners were safely lodged in jail in
Memphis, and then, having settled up all the
business of which he had had charge, he also returned
home.</p>

<p>At the next term of court in Obion County,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
Tennessee, Barton and Taylor pleaded guilty of
grand larceny, and were each sentenced to five
years' confinement at hard labor in the penitentiary.
Thus, out of a party of four engaged in
this robbery, two were finally brought to trial
and appropriately punished, while the other two
would have been so punished also, had not a
higher penalty been demanded by the circumstances
of their cases, aggravated by their own
brutal and revengeful dispositions. No reminiscence
in my experience shows a more striking
illustration of the certainty of retribution for
crime than does the career and fate of these outlaws
of the Southwest.</p>

<p>The history of crimes against prosperity is of
vital interest to the public. The ingenuity
of thieves, burglars, forgers, and confidence men
is active and incessant, so that their plans are
often successful even against the experience and
precautions of men of the most wary and cautious
character. This seems to be especially true when
the amounts at stake are large, for petty attempts
to defraud are so frequent, that when a criminal
plays for a large sum, the suspicion of the capitalist
is wholly allayed by the improbability that
a mere swindler should undertake an operation
of such magnitude. Indeed, in many cases the
cupidity of the victim is so great that the sharper
hardly offers the bait ere it is swallowed by some
confiding simpleton. Hence, as a warning for
the future, the lessons of past frauds possess no
small degree of interest and value to the world;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
and as there is no portion of society free from
the depredations of these schemers, their various
wiles and snares cannot be exposed too often.</p>

<p>More than twenty years ago, the city of
Gloster was one of the most thriving cities of the
West. Controlling the interior trade to a large
extent, its interests were of the most varied character,
and its inhabitants were already distinguished
as being more cosmopolitan than those
of any other city in the Union, except New York.
They had imbibed, perhaps, some of the genius
of the prairies, and their scorn of petty methods
of doing business, their breadth of charity and
hearty hospitality, were as boundless as the great
plains of which the city was the business center
at that time. Among such a people, a plausible
adventurer had a fine field of operation, and I
was not surprised when I was asked to go to
Gloster in the latter part of the winter to investigate
the character of some persons who were
living there.</p>

<p>The application came from Senator Muirhead,
a man whom I had long known, both in his public
and private life. His suspicions were of the
vaguest possible character, and a hasty examination
of the case failed to convince me that they
were well founded; yet he was convinced in his
own mind that there was a fraudulent scheme in
contemplation, and his positive conviction had
great weight with me. The Senator's interest in
the case had led him to make extensive inquiries
into the antecedents of these parties, but he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
unable to trace them further back than their arrival
in New York, several months before. There
they had suddenly appeared in society with a
great display of wealth, stating that they had
been traveling in Europe for some time, and were
gradually making their way back to Peru, where
they lived. Don Pedro P. L. de Morito and his
wife, having enjoyed life in New York for several
months, now proposed to spend at least a year in
Gloster, and it was this couple whose character
was suspected by the Senator. Indeed, he felt
sure that, at least, they were traveling under assumed
names, and certain coincidences led him
to believe that they were adroit swindlers of the
most capable, dangerous type. He had discovered
a chain of circumstantial evidence which needed
only one link to make a clear connection between
certain crimes and these fascinating Peruvians,
and it was for the purpose of discovering this
link that he had requested my aid. In brief, his
suspicions were, that after innumerable frauds in
other countries, this plausible pair had settled in
Gloster to add to their ill-gotten wealth by some
new scheme of villainy. His theoretic history of
the man, derived from various sources, mainly
newspapers in which crimes had been described
bearing the same style of workmanship, was as
follows.</p>

<p>José Gomez, a cadet of the ancient Brazilian
family of that name, began life with a fine physique,
ample mental endowments, and a high social
position. He was the heir-expectant of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
valuable estate, and no pains were spared upon
his education. As he grew to manhood, however,
his habits became such as to excite the
gravest apprehensions as to his future, and by
the time he was thirty years of age he was a
reckless libertine, gambler, and spendthrift. Finding
that his source of supplies was about to be
cut off by his family, he obtained large sums of
money by means of forged paper, with which he
fled from Rio Janeiro to Lima, Peru. His whereabouts
were not discovered for a long time, but
when the information was received, the Brazilian
Government made an effort to obtain his extradition.
He was living in fine style in Lima, under
the assumed name of Juan Sanchez, and, in
some way, he was warned of his danger. Before
any steps had been taken to expose or arrest him,
he perpetrated another series of forgeries, by
which he obtained a large amount of money, and
then wholly disappeared. The aggregate of his
forgeries was so great that a considerable notoriety
attached to the case, and the facts were

<p>About the time of the great rush to California,
after the gold discoveries there, a gentleman
known as Don José Michel appeared in San Francisco,
where he lived in regal splendor; indeed,
his extravagance was so great as to make him
conspicuous even among the reckless throng who
filled the Golden City. After wasting a fortune
with a prodigal hand, however, he suddenly van<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>ished,
and, although little was known positively
on the subject, it was commonly understood that
he had swindled a number of bankers and capitalists
by worthless notes, drafts, and checks,
many of which were wholly or partly forged.
The men thus defrauded kept the matter quiet,
both because they were ashamed to acknowledge
how easily they had been imposed upon, and because
they hoped to facilitate the capture of the
criminal by working in secret. The incidents
were related to Senator Muirhead in a casual conversation
with a friend who had recently returned
from the Pacific coast, and the description
given of Don José Michel tallied exactly with
that of Juan Sanchez and José Gomez.</p>

<p>By an odd coincidence, the month after the departure
of Don José Michel from San Francisco,
a brilliant gentleman of nearly the same name
appeared in Quito, Ecuador, where he pursued a
course so exactly similar in character to that of
Gomez, Sanchez, and Michel, that it was not difficult
to imagine that that ubiquitous person was
identical with the elegant Don Pedro Michel who
created such a brief excitement in Quito, terminating
with forgery and a hasty flight.</p>

<p>About two years previous to the time of which
I write, a wealthy Brazilian arrived in London,
and became a great favorite in society. His wife
was a beautiful Spaniard, and her exquisite taste,
courtesy, and knowledge of the world were highly
appreciated by the select circle of aristocracy into
which she and her husband were soon admitted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
Don José Arias was the name of this gentleman,
and he was soon known in nearly every drawing-room
in Belgravia. He was introduced by the
Brazilian <i>chargé d'affaires</i>, in the absence of the
Minister Resident, and this semi-official guarantee
of his position in Brazil gave him a passport everywhere.
It was not strange, therefore, that such a
handsome, refined, and agreeable couple should
be cordially and hospitably received, especially as
their wealth was undoubtedly enormous, while
their manners showed that they had been born in
the purple of aristocracy. It was a sad shock to
society when it was learned that Don José and
Donna Maria had absconded suddenly, taking with
them about fifty thousand pounds sterling, obtained
by forgery. It was then learned that the
Brazilian legation had been the victim of forged
documents also, though the intimate acquaintance
of Don José with the policy and statecraft of
Brazil in many important affairs had contributed
largely to his success in deceiving the young
diplomat who was temporarily in charge of the
legation.</p>

<p>It was not until more than a year after this occurrence
that Don Pedro P. L. de Morito arrived
in New York, with his beautiful wife, Donna
Lucia. They did not stop long in New York after
their arrival, but spent the latter part of the summer
in the White Mountains in a very retired
manner, although they lived in the best style
that the place afforded. In August, they made
a hasty trip to Washington and back to New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
York again, where they began a more pretentious
mode of life than they had chosen theretofore.
Don Pedro kept a yacht elegantly fitted up, and
his horses were the best that money could obtain.
His bachelor suppers were models of epicurean
perfection, and when his wife gave a reception,
everything was in the best taste and
style. While visiting Washington, Don Pedro
had met Senator Muirhead, who had gone there
for a few days on public business, and the acquaintance
was renewed in New York, where the
Senator had some private interests demanding
his attention. Something had led the Senator to
connect Don Pedro with Gomez, Sanchez, Michel,
and Arias, and though the idea was a vague one
in his mind, it was sufficiently fixed to cause him
to institute inquiries into Señor Morito's antecedents.
As previously stated, nothing could be
learned of him previous to his arrival in New
York, and the only circumstance which could
possibly be regarded as suspicious was, that both
in Washington and New York he had avoided
meeting the Peruvian Minister and other fellow-countrymen.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of the case interested me, and,
after a long conversation with the Senator, I
agreed to unravel the slight mystery surrounding
the parties, and to make a complete review of
their past history so far as it might be possible to
obtain it. No harm could result from such a
course, whether they were honest or the reverse;
and so, having decided upon a simple plan, I re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>turned
to Chicago to select the persons to represent
me in Gloster.</p>

<p>My preliminary survey of the field had brought
me into contact with many of the most fashionable
people in Gloster; and, as I foresaw that my
operatives would be called upon to move in the
best society while engaged in this investigation, I
obtained as extended information about the members
of the <i>crême de la crême</i> as possible. Since
many of them will figure conspicuously in the
incidents of this story, a brief description of the
leaders will be necessary.</p>

<p>One of the wealthiest men of Gloster was a
bachelor, named Henry O. Mather. He was
about fifty years old, but he still retained much
of the fire of youth, and he was one of the most
popular members of society. At an early day in
the history of the Great West he had settled at
Gloster, where he had invested largely in unimproved
lands; and, by forethought and good
judgment in his speculations, he had rapidly increased
his property in extent and value, until,
at this time, he was one of the few millionaires
west of the Alleghanies. About three years previous
to the time of which I write, he had invested
largely in the new railroad schemes then
organized, and his importance as a railway magnate
was recognized throughout the whole country.
His reputation as a shrewd business man
made him a species of authority among his fellow-townspeople,
and few persons would have
ventured to distrust the safety of any enterprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
in which he was actively interested. Indeed, so
complete was the confidence of most men in him,
that it was not considered necessary in buying
real estate to trace the title further back than to
Henry O. Mather, a deed from him being considered
as secure as a patent from the government.
Personally he was a very agreeable man, being
gallant without affectation, and brilliant without
priggishness. His figure was of medium height,
compactly built, and he carried himself with an
erect bearing and springy gait, which greatly
aided in deceiving strangers as to his age. His
hair was brown, turning gradually to gray, and
he wore full gray side-whiskers. His features
were quite pleasing except the mouth, which was
rather large and sensual. On the whole, he was
a man with uncommon ability to please when he
felt disposed to exert himself, and his great
wealth was an additional charm which society
was not slow to recognize. He owned a large
house, occupying the whole of a square in the
most fashionable part of the city, and his sister-in-law
was installed as its mistress.</p>

<p>Richard Perkins was an Englishman who had
long lived in Gloster, where he owned the largest
brewery in the West. He was of middle height,
but being quite fleshy, his gait was a kind of
waddle&mdash;the reverse of elegant or dignified. His
smooth, round, jovial face was strongly expressive
of an appreciation of the good things of this
world, and he rarely denied himself any indulgence
that passion craved and that money could
procure.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>It was while Mather and Perkins were on their
annual visit to New York that they met Señor
Morito and his beautiful wife, Donna Lucia.
The distinguished foreigners soon made a complete
conquest of both the western gentlemen,
who invited them in the most cordial manner to
visit Gloster at their earliest convenience.</p>

<p>The delights of New York society were enjoyed
for several months by these wealthy and aristocratic
foreigners before they were able to keep
the promise made to Mather and Perkins; for
they were entertained by the old Knickerbocker
families of Manhattan in a princely style. They
were the guests of the most exclusive circles of
the city, and everywhere they displayed such
perfect courtesy, good breeding, and <i>savoir faire</i>,
that it was evident they were accustomed to
wealth and high social position. They had elegant
apartments in the leading hotel of the city,
and their cash expenditures showed the possession
of an unlimited fortune. They finally tore
themselves away from New York, arriving in
Gloster during the comparatively dull season of
Lent. Here their fame had become known in
society through the incessant praises of Mather
and Perkins, and their reception into the highest
circles was coincident with their arrival. The
unanimous verdict of those who made their acquaintance
was, that Gloster had never entertained
two more thoroughly pleasing guests than
the Don and Donna Morito.</p>

<p>Don Pedro was about forty years of age, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
he had all the brilliancy and ease of a man of
thirty. His figure was very fine, being slightly
above the medium height, erect, compact, and
muscular. His hands and feet were small and
elegantly shaped, but were not effeminate. His
rich olive complexion was in admirable harmony
with his soft black eyes and deep red lips. His
face was a good oval, without being unmanly,
and his black, glossy hair was beautifully curly
and wavy. He wore side-whiskers and a long
moustache, beneath which his smile, the ladies
said, was faultless. Like most South Americans,
he seemed too lazy to be unamiable, and his general
style was that of a man who, having possessed
wealth always, would be perfectly lost
without it.</p>

<p>Donna Lucia was a fine specimen of Spanish
beauty, education, and refinement. It was easy
to see that she possessed more force of character
than her husband, and that her passionate nature
was like a volcano, which might burst forth at
any time, driving her to the most dangerous
courses if it took possession of her. A detailed
description of such a woman is an impossibility.
In general, she was a beauty of the Andalusian
type, as nearly perfect in form and feature as can
be conceived; but her expression was of an infinite
variety of characters, each one giving the
precise shade of meaning most applicable to the
time, place, person, and sentiment. In short, she
was so near perfection that nearly all the men she
met were in love with her, and nine-tenths of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
them more than half believed that she regretted
her marriage for their sake. Nevertheless, she
kept all admirers at a certain distance, which
only bewitched them the more.</p>

<p>At the time of which I write, Don Pedro was
so much pleased with Gloster, that he had rented
a large residence in a very fashionable locality,
and was making preparations to spend a year
there. The charming manner in which they had
entertained their friends at the hotel was ample
guarantee that when the Don and Donna were
established in their new home, they would surpass
anything in the way of festivities ever seen
in Gloster; hence, all the best society of the place
rejoiced greatly at the arrival of this new constellation
in the social firmament.</p>

<p>Among the bachelors most noted in <i>salons</i> and
parlors of the city were Daniel McCarthy and
Charles Sylvanus, the former a lawyer, and the
latter a journalist. McCarthy was an Irishman,
of brilliant talents and ready wit. Although still
comparatively a young man, he was the county
prosecuting attorney, and was considered one of
the foremost lawyers of the city. He was very
good-looking and good-hearted, and his natural
drollery made him a most entertaining companion.
While speaking in court, and often in society, he
had a habit of running his fingers through his
long, thick hair, which he would also, at times,
throw back with a peculiar jerk of his head.
This habit was especially frequent when he became
deeply interested in his subject, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
spectators could always tell whether Dan was
doing his best, even when they could not hear his
words.</p>

<p>Sylvanus was editor and part proprietor of an
evening newspaper. As a journalist he was not
above mediocrity, but he was well received in
society, where even a moderate allowance of
brains will suffice for success.</p>

<p>A conspicuous member of society and a pillar
of the Swedenborgian church was Mr. John Preston,
a banker and capitalist. With a book of
Swedenborgian revelations in one hand and a
bundle of tax titles in the other, he would frequently
orate to a crowd of unbelievers, from a
text drawn from his book, in a manner calculated
to quite convert them, were it not that they knew
he was only working up a fresh head of steam to
enable him to grind the faces of the poor upon
whose property he held tax titles. In fact, many
people were of the opinion that this man was a
dangerous character, in spite of his pretense of
piety, his ostentatious charity, and his assumption
of the <i>rôle</i> of a professional philanthropist.
They insinuated that a man could afford to give
largely to an astronomical society, a college, an
academy of sciences, and other objects of education,
when he had appropriated many thousands
of dollars belonging to the school fund to his own
use; that he could easily contribute freely to his
church, when he used the church property in his
own interests and managed the society to suit
himself; and that there was no great amount of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
philanthropy in giving a few hundred dollars to
miscellaneous charities, when he made ten times
the amount in shaving notes at usurious interest
and acquiring land by means only one remove
from actual theft; these things were becoming so
notorious that a man of less indomitable brass
than John Preston would have long since been
sent to Coventry, if not to jail; but he revolved
on his own center, sublimely indifferent to the
attacks of his enemies, for whom, by the way, he
used to pray with most fervent unction. His
wife was a pleasant, motherly woman, who gave
liberally to charitable objects, and who regarded
her husband as one of the saints of the earth.</p>

<p>There were three children&mdash;a young man and
two girls. The former gave no promise of either
ability, probity, or ambition, and there was about
him a noticeable air of deficiency in both mental
and moral worth. The girls were commonplace
nonentities, with no pretensions to beauty or
grace.</p>

<p>One of the most prominent citizens of Gloster
was a wealthy tanner, named Charles H. Sanders.
Having foreseen at an early day the great progress
which the city would make in population
and importance, he had invested largely in tracts
of unimproved land, which he held against all
offers to purchase until his real estate was more
extended and valuable than that of any other
property-owner in the city. Personally he was
very thin and angular, with such a sickly look
that his death seemed possible any day, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
his constitution was of that character which
might hold out much longer than that of a more
robust type. His wife was a very charming
woman, and they had two young daughters, who
gave promise of considerable beauty when they
should arrive at maturity.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Burke and his wife were, perhaps,
the most general favorites in Gloster society.
Mr. Burke was tall and well built, and his large
head and commanding appearance made him conspicuous
in any group. He had a broad, high
forehead, heavy eyebrows, deep-set black eyes, a
Roman nose, and a heavy black moustache, which
completely covered his mouth. His straight, black
hair, high cheek-bones, and swarthy complexion,
gave him slightly the look of having Indian blood
in his veins; but the rest of his features were unmistakably
Celtic, and the moment he spoke, the
Irishman stood confessed. He was a man of such
extensive reading and general information that
few persons excelled him in conversation. His
wife was also cultivated and intelligent, so that
either as guest or hostess she was equally agreeable
and popular. They had a large family of
bright and interesting children.</p>

<p>One of the social curiosities of the city was
known as Deacon Humphrey. He was a striking
instance of the importance which self-complacent
mediocrity can obtain in a newly-settled community,
in spite of ponderous stupidity. His
large head gave him his only excuse for professing
to have brains, and his air of preoccupation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
made him in appearance the personification
of wisdom; indeed, a witty journalist, who had
sounded the depths of Humphrey's ignorance,
once said that "no man <i>could</i> be as wise as
Humphrey <i>looked</i>." No better condensation of
this character in a few words could be made. He
was part proprietor of a morning newspaper, and
at times, to the dismay of the other stockholders,
he aspired to the editorial tripod. The mighty
lucubrations of his intellect were generally assigned
to the waste-basket, and in the city it was
well known that his influence in the columns of
the paper was absolutely nothing, though in the
country he was still regarded with awe by the
bucolic mind. He was generally known as
"Deacon" from his honorary occupancy of that
office in a Presbyterian church. Mrs. Humphrey
was seldom seen, being in poor health almost constantly,
but their only daughter, Jennie, was one
of the foremost of the fashionable of the <i>dilettanti</i>
of the city. Indeed, it was confidently anticipated
that, some day, Miss Jennie would burst
forth as a full-blown authoress, and overpower an
expectant public with the radiance of her intellect
and the elegance of her style.</p>

<p>No description of Gloster celebrities would be
complete without that of Ethan Allen Benson,
Esq., formerly Member of Congress, and late
Minister Plenipotentiary at an important European
court. The suggestion having once been
made to him by some waggish diplomat that he
resembled the first Napoleon, he was ever after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>ward
desirous of drawing attention to this fancied
resemblance. He was a vain, fussy, consequential
politician, whose principal strength was
in the ward caucus and the saloon.</p>

<p>Judge Peter B. Taylor was another old settler,
and he was frequently seen in social circles in
spite of his age. His forehead was very broad
indeed, but his face tapered so rapidly to a
pointed chin as to make his head wedge-shaped.
He had coarse, faded hair, but no whiskers nor
beard, and only a scrubby, gray moustache. He
had a singular habit of working his eyes independently
of each other, and the effect upon a
stranger who was not aware of this peculiarity
was sometimes startling. His mouth was quite
large, one side appearing larger than the other,
and his lower lip slightly protruded, giving him a
very harsh and forbidding appearance. He had
at one time occupied a seat on the judicial bench,
but few persons could understand on what
grounds he deserved the office, unless it were
that people believed the adage about a poor lawyer
making a good judge. He was quite wealthy,
and his business was that of a money loaner and
real estate speculator. He was considered to be
very pious and charitable&mdash;on Sunday; during
the rest of the week no Shylock ever demanded
his pound of flesh more relentlessly than he his
three per cent a month.</p>

<p>It was among a society of which the foregoing
were shining lights, that I was to operate at the
request of Senator Muirhead. On returning to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
Chicago from Gloster, I gave a great deal of
thought to the case, for there was so little to act
upon that none of the ordinary plans could be
depended upon. During his stay in this country,
Don Pedro had apparently acted in a perfectly
honorable manner toward every one, and it
would be impossible to proceed against him legally
in the United States for crimes committed
elsewhere, until the aggrieved parties should take
the necessary steps for his extradition; with several
of the countries in which he was supposed to
have committed his crimes we had no extradition
treaty, and nothing could be done here to arrest
or punish him; hence, the task of exposing his
previous career might be fruitless, even though
the Senator's suspicions should be confirmed in
every particular. Nothing whatever could be
adduced against his character since his arrival in
the United States, and I was, therefore, confined
to the prevention of future frauds rather than
the detection of old ones. The primary object of
my efforts was thus made to be the discovery of
the Don's intentions, as, without some slight
forecast of his plans, I might be unable to circumvent
them. Accordingly, I decided that I
must furnish him with a friend who would be
sufficiently intimate with him to become his
trusted companion and adviser. At the same
time, it would be essential to learn as much as
possible relative to the previous career of both
the Don and Donna, for it might be desirable to
use a little moral suasion with them by showing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
that their history was known. This plan would
involve no injustice to them, for, if innocent of
wrong-doing, they would never know that they
had been under surveillance; while, if guilty,
they deserved no consideration.</p>




<p class="center">CHAPTER II.
</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Madame Sevier, Widow, of Chicago, and Monsieur
Lesparre, of Bordeaux, also arrive at Gloster.&mdash;Mr.
Pinkerton, as a Laborer, anxious for a Job,
inspects the Morito Mansion.&mdash;A Tender Scene,
resulting in Profit to the fascinating Señora.&mdash;Madame
Sevier is installed as a Guest at Don
Pedro's.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>My first action in this affair was to detail a
man to "shadow" Don Pedro and the
Donna until the detectives chosen for the more
difficult portions of the work should be in a position
to take notice of all their movements. As
three detectives would require some little preparation
to gain the position I desired them to fill, I
hastened to select them and give them their
instructions. For this mission I detailed a
married couple, who had been several years in
my employ. Mr. and Mrs. Rosel were natives of
France, and as they had been constantly in my
service almost from the time of their arrival in
this country, I felt sure they would not be recognized
as detectives by any one in the city of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
Gloster. They were people of more than average
intelligence and education, with a natural refinement
which would be especially desirable in the
prosecution of this case. In a few days all their
preparations were completed, and they went to
Gloster by different routes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rosel was not handsome, but she had a
good figure, and she was very attractive, on account
of her dashing, spirited ways, and because
she could assume a deep interest in every one
whom she met. She spoke English with so slight
an accent that it was only noticed as an added
charm to her winning conversation. I instructed
her to represent herself in Gloster as Madame
Sevier, the widow of a lace merchant, lately of
Chicago, where he had carried on a moderate
business. His death had thrown his affairs into
some confusion, but the estate would be settled
up soon, leaving a comfortable fortune to his
widow. Madame Sevier did not like the climate
of Chicago, and therefore she had decided to
remain in Gloster until her business affairs were
settled, when she would probably return to her
relatives in France. I intended that she should
mix in society as much as would be consistent
with her character as a widow, and that she
should endeavor to become intimate with Donna
Lucia.</p>

<p>Mr. Rosel was to make a slight detour, arriving
in Gloster from the east. He would be known
as Monsieur Girard Lesparre, and his ostensible
character was to be that of a man of moderate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
capital from Bordeaux, looking for a favorable
opportunity to invest some of his means in a
profitable business.</p>

<p>I followed the Rosels in a day or two, and found
that Monsieur Lesparre was pleasantly located
at a fashionable family hotel, while Madame
Sevier had taken apartments in a stylish boarding-house
only a few doors from the handsome
residence which the Moritos were to occupy.
This was quite satisfactory, and I turned my
attention to the examination of the reports made
by my "shadow." The reports were very monotonous
in character, except as evidences of the
popularity of the Don and Donna. The dull days
of Lent had just passed, and the close of the
season was now more crowded with parties and
balls than the earlier portion had been. The
presence of two such distinguished guests as Don
Pedro and Donna Lucia contributed largely to the
reasons for this rush of gayety, and they were
overwhelmed with visitors and invitations. Mr.
Mather had set the example by giving a large
dinner-party in their honor, followed in the evening
by a grand ball; and they had so charmed
the other leaders of society that no entertainment
was considered complete without the presence
of Don Pedro P. L. de Morito and his beautiful
wife.</p>

<p>On leaving my hotel to visit the house which
Don Pedro was fitting up for his residence, I met
Charlie Morton, the United States Commissioner
of Gloster. Morton was a capable lawyer and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
shrewd politician. He was equally attentive to
ladies as to gentlemen, and it was well known
that Charlie would never slight any one who
could cast or influence a vote. His acquaintance
extended through all classes, from the lowest to
the highest, and few men were more generally
popular. His powers of observation were only
equaled by his tact, so that, while he saw all
that went on about him, he never talked indiscreetly.
He and I were quite intimate, and we
chatted for some time about various people before
I succeeded in bringing up the names of those in
Gloster in whom I was just then most interested.</p>

<p>"I suppose you are quite glad that the gay season
is over, Charlie," I said, interrogatively. "As
usual, you will not have many social events of
any consequence after Lent, I presume?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, indeed," he replied; "we shall be
more active in society for the next month or two
than ever before. You see, we have two wealthy
and aristocratic Peruvians visiting Gloster, and
they are so fascinating that they have quite taken
our people by storm. They have been accustomed
to the finest society of Europe and South
America, so that we are put upon our mettle to
show how well Gloster can compare in wealth,
luxury, and refinement with older cities at home
and abroad."</p>

<p>"Are they then such remarkable lions?" I
asked, "or do people run after them simply because
they are rich foreigners?"</p>

<p>"Of course their wealth and foreign birth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
would cause many people to pay them attention,"
said Morton; "but their popularity is something
exceptional, and is undoubtedly due to their perfect
knowledge of all the courtesies and customs
of modern society, to their charming manners,
and largely to their personal good looks. Señor
Morito has fascinated all the ladies, while nearly
every man in society is in love with the Señora."</p>

<p>"Well, take care of yourself, my boy," I said,
jokingly. "If the lovely Donna causes Charlie
Morton to strike his colors, she must be dangerous
indeed."</p>

<p>After leaving Morton, I sauntered along to the
house which Don Pedro had rented, and which
was now nearly ready for occupancy. It was a
large residence, with ample grounds fronting on
the principal avenue, and its imposing front of
heavy columns gave it a striking appearance as
compared with the more commonplace stone
fronts around it. While I was glancing curiously
about, a truck arrived laden with costly furniture.
I was rather roughly dressed, and the driver
asked me if I wanted a job of work. I accepted
his offer to aid in carrying the furniture into the
house, as I was anxious to examine the interior.
After finishing the job, the furniture salesman
took me over the house to show off the elegance
with which it was decorated and furnished. It
was certainly a model of good taste, while the
paintings, statuary, frescoing, and articles of
<i>bijouterie</i> were evidences of enormous expenditures.
Having obtained a thorough knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
of the plan of the house, I withdrew, receiving
fifty cents for my labor.</p>

<p>The time when Don Pedro was to occupy his
residence was to be signalized by a grand reception
held therein, and the invitations were already
out. Meantime entertainments were given by
John Preston, Alexander McIntyre, and Charles
H. Sanders. The latter's reception was especially
brilliant, and those who knew Mr. Sanders's parsimonious
character were much surprised at his
profuse expenditure for the occasion. I soon
afterwards obtained an explanation of this unusual
liberality, by hearing another banker casually
remark that Don Pedro had withdrawn a
part of his funds from New York, and had deposited
them in Mr. Sanders's bank. This gave
me a hint, and I immediately acted upon it. Being
well acquainted with a number of bankers, I
visited several of them, and talked about various
business men of Gloster, as if I were desirous of
getting information about their commercial standing
and credit. In each case I succeeded in learning
the extent to which Don Pedro had deposited
money in bank. The total amount then due him
by the three houses with whom he had made deposits
was about $17,000, although his original
deposits had amounted to more than double that
sum. Heavy drafts to pay his current expenses
and to furnish his house had largely reduced his
available cash, though he still had an ample sum
on hand. Knowing how enormous his expenses
were, I felt sure that he would reach the end of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
his bank account in a short time, unless he should
have other funds, of whose existence I was unaware.
If this sum of seventeen thousand dollars
represented his total capital, however, he
would soon show whether he was what he
claimed to be, or an adventurer; for, in the
former case, he would draw money from his
Peruvian estates, and, in the latter, he would accomplish
some great swindle. I was, therefore,
anxious to put my detectives at work as quickly
as possible to enable me to learn something definite
of his intentions.</p>

<p>Madame Sevier was making quite rapid progress
in her new quarters. Mrs. Courtney, the lady
who kept the house, was a widow of some means,
who took boarders to enable her to educate her
children in the best manner. She was highly regarded
by every one, and her visiting-list included
all the most fashionable people in the city. She
soon became greatly interested in Madame Sevier,
and through her assistance the Madame made
the acquaintance of a number of the families
living in the neighborhood. As the rage for foreigners
was at its height just then, Madame Sevier
soon became highly popular, and she was invited
to several entertainments, where she met Don
Pedro and Donna Lucia. The latter, finding that
Madame Sevier was to be her near neighbor in
her new residence, became very intimate with
her, especially as Donna Lucia was desirous of
reviving her knowledge and practice of the French
language. Consequently, when Don Pedro's ar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>rangements
were all completed and the new
house occupied, Madame Sevier used to drop in
for a few minutes' chat every day. As she was
a very capable manager, she was frequently able
to give Donna Lucia valuable hints about her
household affairs, especially with reference to the
approaching reception.</p>

<p>Ever since the arrival of the Moritos, Mr. Henry
O. Mather had been a constant attendant upon
the Donna. His attentions had not been so publicly
marked as to have created scandal; but he
had been so assiduous in paying his regards, that
he was much more intimate than Mrs. Grundy
would have thought strictly proper. He was in
the habit of calling very frequently, and he often
took the Don and Donna out for a drive. Sometimes
the party would consist wholly of ladies,
and occasionally the Donna accompanied him
alone. In short, he became a sort of intimate
friend of the family, welcome at all times, without
the necessity of invitation or ceremony.</p>

<p>One day, Madame Sevier went in to see Donna
Lucia in the afternoon, and was told by the servant
that she would find the Donna in the library.
Without permitting the servant to announce her,
she passed on toward the room mentioned; but,
as she approached the door, hearing voices within,
she paused a moment to see who was with
Donna Lucia. The room was in a very retired
part of the house, and she was able to take a position
close to the partly open door without the
probability of being noticed by any one. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
was thus enabled to overhear a highly interesting
conversation between the Donna and Henry O.
Mather, who had evidently arrived only a moment
or two before her.</p>

<p>"You are not in good spirits to-day, Donna
Lucia?" questioned Mather, sympathetically.</p>

<p>"No, Mr. Mather; I have my troubles at
times, like other people, but I try not to let
others see them."</p>

<p>"Then you do not care for sympathy, Señora,"
said Mather, with a tender sigh; "I see that you
have been in tears, and it grieves me to think
that I cannot save you from the painful things
which cause you to cry."</p>

<p>"Oh! Mr. Mather, I do appreciate your kindness,
I assure you," said the Donna, also sighing
deeply; "I am almost tempted to ask your advice,
for I feel that you are truly my friend; but
I am afraid you will think I have been naughty
in having exposed myself to such annoyances."</p>

<p>"No, indeed, my dear Donna," replied the millionaire,
quite enraptured at this evident token
of her confidence in him; "I know that you are
too lovely to be anything but an angel, and I
shall be only too happy to give you advice upon
any subject that you confide to me."</p>

<p>As the conversation was becoming highly interesting,
the tones of the parties being of a
really lover-like tenderness, Madame Sevier took
a hasty glimpse through the door, and saw that
she could watch as well as listen, unperceived.
Mather was standing beside the Donna, bending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
over her and looking into her face, while she had
her head half turned away, as if in coy indecision.</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Mather&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why do you address me always so formally?
Can you not call me Henry?" asked Mather,
boldly.</p>

<p>"How would it sound if any one should hear
me?" said the Donna, casting down her eyes and
playing with her watch-chain.</p>

<p>"But when we are alone no one can hear
you," replied Mather. "Won't you call me
Henry when we have an occasional <i>tête-à-tête</i>?"</p>

<p>"Well, then you must be very discreet, Henry,"
answered she, looking up, blushing and hesitating
as she spoke.</p>

<p>"I will be discretion itself," said the now
wholly infatuated Mather, with a look of
triumph; and to show that he accepted the conditions
of the agreement, he sealed it by raising
her hand to his lips.</p>

<p>"Oh! fie! fie!" she exclaimed; "is it thus that
you show your discretion? I shall be obliged
to retract my promise if you become so rash.
Now, sit down beside me, and be more polite in
future."</p>

<p>"I will not be so hasty again, my dear Donna;
but my pleasure was so great that I was somewhat
beside myself. Now tell me what it was
that caused your troubles."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Math&mdash;&mdash;"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no; not 'Mr. Mather;' recollect your
promise," interrupted Mather, as he saw she hesitated
to call him by his first name.</p>

<p>"Well, then, Henry, I have been very thoughtless
and extravagant, and I do not know what to
do. You see, I have always spent money for
everything I needed without regard to cost; for
my own fortune was ample for everything, and
Pedro would give me any amount that I might
desire. But last month a draft for six thousand
pounds, which was sent me by my trustees, was
lost on the way, and so I have used up all my
own funds. Having run up several large bills in
New York, I asked Pedro to pay them, and he
did so; but he said that, having ordered his factors
to send him no more money until his arrival
in Callao, he should be somewhat embarrassed
until he heard from them again. His sudden
determination to fit up and occupy a residence
here has exhausted all his available funds except
a few thousand dollars for current expenses, and
he requested me not to make any large purchases
until one of us should receive a remittance from
our estates. Well, you see, I expected surely to
have received a large sum before now, and so I
made purchases without regard to consequences;
the result is, that I am deeply in debt, my money
has not arrived, and I am afraid to tell Pedro,
because he will not forgive me for running in
debt and disobeying him. Unfortunately, I have
done both these things, and I am momentarily in
fear that some of the bills will be sent to him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Now, my dear Henry, you see that I have good
cause to look sad and cry."</p>

<p>As she finished, the Donna began to whimper
and put her handkerchief to her eyes in so touching
a manner that Mather was quite overpowered.
The artistic expression with which she
hastily called him her "dear Henry" was the
finishing touch to an already powerful attack,
and he surrendered completely.</p>

<p>"My dear Donna," he exclaimed, seizing her
hand in both of his, "how glad I am that you
confided in me. I will see that you are not
troubled by another anxious thought in this matter.
Tell me how much you need to settle all
your indebtedness."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Henry, I cannot let you do anything
of the kind," she protested, feebly. "Why, it is a
very large sum in all, and it may be several
months before I can repay you."</p>

<p>"Now don't talk about payment, but just tell
me how much you need," replied Mather.</p>

<p>"The large bills amount to over four thousand
dollars, and there are a number of small ones
which I have not figured up," she said, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I will bring you around five
thousand dollars to-morrow, and you can pay
the bills without any one knowing where the
money comes from," said Mather, again kissing
her hand.</p>

<p>"Oh! you dear, good fellow!" exclaimed the
Donna; and, overcome by his generous response<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
to her request, she threw her arms about his neck
and kissed him several times.</p>

<p>"There, there," she continued, releasing herself
and coquettishly tapping his lips with her
hand, "I don't know how I came to do such a
thing, but you were so kind that I couldn't help
it."</p>

<p>"If that is the case," said the overjoyed
Mather, "I will add five thousand more to have
a similar expression of your gratitude."</p>

<p>"Will you, really? I believe I am half in love
with you," she murmured, as she allowed him to
embrace her a second time, and press burning
kisses on her lips.</p>

<p>The ringing of the door-bell interrupted their
happiness, and Madame Sevier hastily retired to
the drawing-room, into which other visitors were
shown by the servant. Donna Lucia soon entered,
perfectly self-possessed, and greeted all her
friends with her usual ease and cordiality. Mr.
Mather probably passed out by the library entrance,
for he did not appear in the parlor. The
ladies conversed together for some time, one of
the important subjects of their talk being the
troubles of household management. Donna Lucia
complained bitterly that her servants robbed her,
and that they were careless, dirty, and impudent.
She knew very little about housekeeping, and
every domestic in her employ took advantage of
her. She added that, as soon as her housewarming
was over, she intended to get, if possible, a
lady who would be a member of the family, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
who would relieve her of the management of the
house.</p>

<p>"Now," said she, in her most winning manner,
"here is Madame Sevier, who has nothing
to occupy her time, who is a natural manager of
other people, and who is so agreeable that she
would be a positive charm to any household; and
I have been thinking, positively, of asking her to
take charge of my whole establishment, and help
me entertain my guests. What should you think,
Madame Sevier, of such a request?"</p>

<p>The opportunity of becoming domesticated in
the Morito mansion was thus afforded to one of
my detectives, but she knew better than to
accept at once. She therefore professed to treat
it as a pleasantly, and said that she had no doubt
that she should succeed as a housekeeper, but
whether she could add anything of attraction to
such a charming home was greatly to be doubted.
The other ladies, however, thought the idea an
admirable one, and they all urged Madame Sevier
to adopt it. Having once broached the subject,
Donna Lucia again spoke of it with the greatest
interest, showing, by her arguments and determination
to coax Madame Sevier to decide favorably,
that she had thought about such a plan before,
and that she was really in earnest in her request.
Finally, Madame Sevier said that she saw
no objection to accepting the offer, as she really
enjoyed taking care of a large establishment, but
she was not prepared to accept it at once, and
she would wait a few days to reflect upon it. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
was then agreed that she should give her decision
at the grand reception to be given as a housewarming.</p>

<p>This part of my plan had worked admirably,
and I felt confident of my eventual success in
learning all about the affairs of the Morito
family. The method by which Donna Lucia had
obtained ten thousand dollars from Mr. Mather
was a decided confirmation of Senator Muirhead's
suspicions; though there was nothing in the
transaction which could make her liable to punishment
by law, and as there was no danger that
her victim would ever appear against her, I paid
no further attention to this episode.</p>

<p>I ordered Madame Sevier to accept Donna
Lucia's offer on the following terms: she should
have full authority over all the female servants in
the house; she should have charge of the ordering
of all articles for household use; she should be
considered in the same light as a guest, so far as
social intercourse went; she should go and come
as she chose, without regard to the duties of the
<i>ménage</i>; and she should receive no salary. This
last point she was to insist upon, as necessary
to preserve her feeling of independence, and
enable her to occupy her time as she might see
fit.</p>

<p>As the day approached for the Moritos' reception,
all Gloster's best society were filled with
pleasurable excitement and anticipation, as the
preparations were known to be far more magnificent
than those for any similar entertainment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
since Gloster was settled. As Monsieur Lesparre
had already made Don Pedro's acquaintance,
and had received an invitation, I felt sure that
I should be thoroughly informed as to all the
occurrences of the evening, and so I awaited developments.</p>

<p>The employment of detectives to penetrate into
the social life and domestic surroundings of any
family is strongly repugnant to my sense of propriety,
and I rarely countenance the practice, if I
can possibly attain my object in any other way.
I dislike to feel that I am trespassing upon the
privacy of any man's home, even though that
man may be a criminal. The idea of introducing
a spy into a household is opposed to the spirit of
our free American institutions, violating, as it
does, the unwritten law that "a man's house is
his castle;" hence, I never resort to such a measure,
except in extreme cases. I saw, however, that
there was no other means of protecting the interests
of my client, Senator Muirhead; he was
acting disinterestedly in the case, to save his constituents
from being defrauded, and I could only
prevent the threatened swindle by learning in
advance the exact plan of operation proposed by
the suspected person.</p>

<p>I was careful, however, to employ my most
discreet and cautious agents, in order that I should
quickly learn whether the Senator's suspicions
were based on fact; in case I should find that the
suspected parties were innocent, I was determined
to withdraw instantly. They would not then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
suffer any injustice, for my employés would keep
their discoveries secret from every one except myself,
and no one would ever know that they had
been the objects of suspicion.</p>




<p class="center">CHAPTER III.
</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Monsieur Lesparre, having a retentive memory, becomes
serviceable to Don Pedro.&mdash;Diamond Fields and
droll Americans.&mdash;A pompous Judge in an unfortunate
Predicament.&mdash;The grand Reception closes
with the happy Arrangement that the gay Señor
and Señora shall dine with Mr. Pinkerton's Detectives
on the next evening.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>The day of the reception was unusually pleasant,
and at nightfall the full moon rose to
add her splendor to the attractiveness of the
evening. The Morito mansion was ablaze with
wax candles, gaslight being considered too common
for use on such an occasion. From the street
to the door was a passageway of double canvas,
with an opening at the sidewalk to prevent interference
with passers. This opening was brilliantly
lighted, and was hung with flags, pennants, and
flowers, artistically arranged so as to give the
guests a charming prospect when alighting from
their carriages. The rooms of the house needed
no decoration beyond that already given by the
frescoes and paintings adorning the walls and
ceilings. Nevertheless, flowers were abundantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
distributed about the spacious apartments. The
beautiful conservatory contained a superb fountain,
whose jets and sprays gave forth exquisite
odor and rippling music. Everywhere throughout
the house the most artistic grouping of
furniture, pictures, and statuary could be seen,
and the variety of taste displayed was only
equaled by the unity of arrangements as a
whole. At ten o'clock the guests began to arrive,
and as the throng of carriages became thicker,
it seemed as if the house would be over-crowded.
This did not happen to any noticeable degree,
however, as the whole of two floors were thrown
open to accommodate the guests. The music
was furnished by the best musicians of the city,
and the supper was a miracle of epicurean excellence
Delmonico having sent one of his chief
assistants from New York to superintend its
preparation. Never had Gloster seen an affair
where such elegance and good taste had been
displayed; even the smallest details were perfect,
and the Don and Donna received innumerable
congratulations and good wishes from their
guests.</p>

<p>During his brief stay in Gloster, Monsieur Lesparre
had been very active in forming acquaintances,
and he was already well known in society.
He had a very retentive memory, and, when once
introduced to any gentleman, he immediately
took pains to learn everything possible about him.
By careful observation and perseverance, he had
learned the general history of a very large num<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>ber
of the leading people in society, and his droll
comments and half-sarcastic criticism of them,
expressed <i>sotto voce</i> to the Don on various occasions,
had caught the latter's attention. The
Don therefore frequently singled out Lesparre for
a companion in society, in order to obtain information
about the social and business standing of
various people.</p>

<p>"You see, my dear Lesparre," said the Don,
"I am such a poor judge of character that I am
liable to be imposed upon unless I know something
about the previous history of people who
seek my friendship. And, as I have a miserable
memory for faces, names, places, and everything
else, it is a great pleasure to find some one who
can keep me posted as to the status of the people
I meet. You must let me see as much of you as
possible, for, being both foreigners, we ought to
have a common bond of sympathy."</p>

<p>"It will give me great pleasure," replied Lesparre.
"Of course our friends here are very attentive;
but then, you know, they lack the polish
one meets in European <i>salons</i>, and they are too
apt to obtrude their business into their social
relations."</p>

<p>"Exactly; I agree with you perfectly, and it is
for that reason that I enjoy a conversation with
a gentleman of Continental education and tastes.
It is wonderful how keen these Americans are in
their pursuit of the 'Almighty Dollar.' Why,
only a week or two ago, I happened to mention
to Mr. Mather and a few others, that some of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
estates in the Peruvian Andes contained extensive
diamond fields, when they began to upbraid me
for not working them and adding to my already
ample revenue. They seemed positively shocked
when I told them, that I saw no reason for increasing
my income, as I had as much money as
I could use now. They insisted that I was doing
a positive wrong to my fellow mortals in refusing
to burden myself with a new enterprise, and I
assure you they were quite in earnest in their remonstrances.
Ah! how droll they are, Monsieur
Lesparre!"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, I have found the same spirit
even with reference to my humble means," replied
Lesparre. "They want me to invest in
something right away, and I have very many
disinterested offers of advice; but they cannot
understand my delay, and they think I am throwing
away so many good chances by waiting.
Now, I should be content to settle down for a
year, before investing, just to examine at length
all the openings offered me; but I doubt whether
I could afford to do that, unless I could obtain a
satisfactory salaried position, and I feel that that
is impossible. There are very few such positions
as I would be willing to accept, as I do not care
to be tied down to regular duties."</p>

<p>The gentlemen had stepped into the supper-room
while this conversation was going on, and
were about to take a glass of wine together.
Lesparre's last remark seemed to give a sudden
idea to Don Pedro, and he sipped his wine in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
silence for a moment or two. Then he said,
inquiringly:</p>

<p>"I suppose you would like a position of a responsible
character, where your knowledge of
commercial and financial affairs would be available,
but where your whole time would not be
absorbed?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that was my wish," answered Lesparre;
"but, of course, I do not expect to realize my
hopes."</p>

<p>"Possibly you may, Monsieur Lesparre," said
Don Pedro; "but let us leave the subject of business
until to-morrow, when I should like to talk
with you more fully about this matter. Now, let
us return to the drawing-room, and when you see
any of my guests approaching, please, tell me
briefly who and what they are. For instance,
tell me about that stiff and military-looking person
crossing the room."</p>

<p>"That is Captain Adrian L. Kerr, a retired
army officer, who has lived here a long time. He
has been unsuccessful in business, and it would
be difficult to account for his means of livelihood
were it not that his wife, the brilliant brunette
near the mantel-piece, is supposed to have an income
of her own. Some people are so ill-natured
as to suggest that Alexander McIntyre, the
wealthy Scotch banker now talking to her, is the
source of her revenue, but that may be pure gossip.
At any rate, she is always elegantly dressed,
and she moves in the best society."</p>

<p>"If people suspect her of improper intimacy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
with McIntyre, why do they admit her to their
houses?" asked Don Pedro.</p>

<p>"Well, you see, many of the merchants and
business men have financial dealings with McIntyre,
and they do not dare to offend him. As an
illustration of his power, I will relate an incident
that occurred recently. The wife of a well-known
merchant was about to give a large party, and,
in making out her list of invitations, she purposely
left out the name of Mrs. Kerr. Her husband,
on going to the bank to obtain the renewal
of a note, found McIntyre as surly and savage as
a bear, and the renewal was refused. As he had
never before had any difficulty in obtaining such
an accommodation when hard pressed for money,
he could not account for the change in McIntyre's
conduct; but when his wife informed him of her
action the day previous in withholding an invitation
from Mrs. Kerr, he understood it all. His
affairs were in such a condition that he could not
afford to quarrel with McIntyre, and so he insisted
that an invitation be sent to Mrs. Kerr, in
spite of his wife's assertion that Mrs. Kerr was
an improper character. He was willing to admit
that fact, but he preferred to submit to her presence
rather than to be seriously crippled in
business. An invitation was therefore sent in
such a way as to make the delay in its delivery
appear accidental, and in a few days Mr. McIntyre
was willing to renew the merchant's note."</p>

<p>"Well, she certainly does carry things with a
high hand," replied Don Pedro, smiling. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
wonder how she would have retaliated upon me
if I had struck her name off my list to-night?
However, it is not my business to question her
character, and if my wife is satisfied to receive
her, I shall not interfere."</p>

<p>As the Don finished speaking, the music
sounded the preliminary notes of a quadrille,
and he hastened to find a partner. Among the
guests were Mr. and Mrs. Arlington, whose
minds were of such opposite characters as to
keep them continually quarreling. He was a
wealthy banker of austere manners and Puritanic
tastes, while she was a butterfly of fashion,
fit only to be petted, kissed, and caressed. She
was all gayety and life; he, all piety and gloom.
Her pleasures he considered sinful, while his
recreations were to her the most painfully melancholy
observances that could be devised.
While he believed that she was a child of wrath,
a creature of the world, the flesh, and the devil,
she was equally satisfied that he was on the
highway to fanaticism and hypocrisy. Under
these circumstances, it was not unnatural that
she should seek her friends among those who
mingled in fashionable society, nor that her husband
should consider it necessary to follow her
into the gay world in order to keep a watch
upon her. Her most attentive cavalier was a
young bachelor named Harry Bertram, who
seemed infatuated with her. Indeed, their preference
for each other's society was so marked
that the tongue of scandal had already begun to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
wag, although no overt act could be cited against
them. The Don, on leaving Lesparre, chanced
to meet Mrs. Arlington, and she readily accorded
him the pleasure of dancing with her. In the
same set were Daniel McCarthy and Donna Lucia,
Charles Sylvanus and Madame Sevier, and
Mr. Mather and Mrs. Simon. In the adjoining
set were Mr. Benson and Miss Jennie Humphrey,
Alexander McIntyre and Mrs. Kerr, Harry Bertram
and Mrs. Sanders, and Judge Robert Morgan
and Mrs. Middleton.</p>

<p>Judge Morgan was a remarkable-looking person
at any time, but his appearance was especially
noticeable in a dancing-set, the incongruity of
his presence in such a scene being irresistibly
comical. He was about fifty years of age, but
his face was smooth and unwrinkled; though he
was of the medium height, his great size gave
him the look of a short man, which effect was
partly increased by his long arms. He was very
broad and fat, his stomach projecting to an absurd
degree. At the same time he stood very
erect, so that a profile view gave him a general
resemblance to a loggerhead turtle set on end.
His eyes were small and treacherous, his cheeks
were puffy and flabby, his mouth was large and
sensual. His hair and whiskers were brown and
fine, but they always seemed unkempt. He wore
closely-fitting black clothes, and he was fond of
displaying an unusual amount of jewelry. He
had obtained the office of judge of the criminal
court by currying favor with the very classes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a><br /><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>most likely to be brought before him for trial,
and his judicial ermine was not considered free
from the foulest stains. His private life was, in
many respects, a counterpart of his official conduct;
though married to an agreeable woman,
he was a notorious libertine and profligate. Still,
he held his position in society, and was admitted
to the acquaintance of the most reputable people
in the city; hence, he frequently appeared at
balls and dancing-parties, where he always tried
to act like a light and graceful youth.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <i>The Judge's downfall.</i>]</p>

<p>On this occasion he was especially anxious to
display his manly form in the same set with the
Donna, but being disappointed in this, he chose
the set next to hers, and acted like a playful hippopotamus.
While backing rapidly, in an attempt
to balance to his partner, he came in contact
with Mrs. Simon of the next set, and, tripping
on her dress, he fell violently upon her.
Her partner, Mr. Mather, tried to catch her as
she also fell, but the ponderous form of the
Judge came upon them both with crushing effect,
and all three were brought to the floor at once.
Mr. Mather and Mrs. Simon were quickly on
their feet again, flushed with mortification but
unhurt. But it was no such easy matter for the
corpulent Judge to raise himself erect; he lay on
his back a moment groaning, and it was thought
that he might be seriously injured, as his fall had
jarred the whole house. Several gentlemen carefully
lifted him upright, and the ladies gathered
about to condole with him, when it was suddenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
discovered that, if the Judge's person had not
suffered, his clothing had. His tight dress coat
was split several inches down the back, while a
hasty glimpse behind his coat-tails satisfied the
spectators that his pants were in an even worse
condition than his coat. It may be imagined
that the situation caused some merriment, in
spite of the efforts of the more well-bred guests
to preserve their gravity; but when the Judge,
having regained his feet, vociferated in great
wrath: "You are a pack of monkeys. I don't
see anything to laugh at," there was a universal
burst of laughter which could not be repressed.
This so enraged him that it was difficult to make
him understand his absurd position, but at length
Don Pedro and Monsieur Lesparre induced him
to go to the dressing-room for repairs. As there
was no coat in the house large enough for him,
the Don was at his wits' end to make him sufficiently
presentable to enable him to return to the
drawing-room; but at length the Judge was
arrayed in one of the Don's gorgeous dressing-gowns,
which was large enough to hide most of
the effects of the fall. He soon returned to the
lower rooms dressed in the most remarkable costume
ever worn at a full-dress party in Gloster.</p>

<p>With the exception of this accident, the evening
passed off with the most perfect success,
and the unanimous verdict was that there had
never been a more thoroughly enjoyable entertainment
given in the city. During the evening,
Madame Sevier informed Donna Lucia of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
willingness to take charge of the Morito establishment,
and agreed to begin her reign the next
day. Donna Lucia was delighted at this news,
and willingly accepted all the conditions, though
she insisted for some time on giving Madame
Sevier a liberal salary. Finding that Madame
Sevier was resolute in her refusal to receive pay,
the Donna informed her friends that she had invited
Madame Sevier to live with her, and that
the Madame had kindly agreed to assist her in
entertaining her numerous guests.</p>

<p>It was not until nearly daybreak that the more
indefatigable revelers became weary of dancing
and flirting, so that the Donna was quite exhausted
when the last guest had departed.
Madame Sevier remained to the end, as she intended
occupying her room in the Morito mansion
at once, instead of returning to her boarding-place.
Donna Lucia left orders that she was not
to be disturbed until five o'clock in the afternoon,
but Madame Sevier decided to get up at twelve
o'clock, in order to superintend the work of clearing
away the decorations and <i>débris</i> of the ball.
The Don had invited Monsieur Lesparre to dine
with him at six o'clock, and so it was arranged
that they should all meet at that hour.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>Madame Sevier began her work of reform
in the household as soon as she was
dressed that afternoon. Finding that they now
had a mistress competent to control them, the
servants showed a greater willingness to be useful,
though some of them were inclined to be
lazy and impudent as before. The Madame made
mental notes of everything, took charge of the
keys to all storerooms and closets, and clearly
demonstrated that she was able to manage the
house according to her own ideas. The cook,
thinking she was indispensable, and that she
could act independent of control, was very impertinent
to Madame, and she evinced an insubordinate
spirit that created a good deal of trouble.
Seeing that prompt and severe measures were
necessary, Madame Sevier paid this woman her
wages and discharged her without a moment's
warning. The effect upon the other servants
was most satisfactory, and although the Madame
was obliged to make some minor changes after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a><br /><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a><br /><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>ward,
she was never again annoyed by impertinence
or presumption. The dinner for that day
was prepared by the assistant cook, under
Madame Sevier's direction, and when the Don
and Donna came down from their chamber, they
were delighted to find that the house was in perfect
order, showing no signs of having been the
scene of revelry and dissipation the night before.</p>

<p>[Illustration: Madame Sevier discharging the servants.]</p>

<p>During dinner, at which Monsieur Lesparre
was the only guest, Don Pedro, after complimenting
Madame Sevier very highly upon her
success in bringing order out of chaos, turned to
his wife and said:</p>

<p>"Lucia, your selection of a companion and advisor
has been so fortunate that I am more than
ever disposed to follow your example. What do
you think, Monsieur Lesparre, cannot you serve
me as confidential secretary and financial agent
as satisfactorily as Madame Sevier assists my
wife?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, Don Pedro," replied Lesparre, gallantly,
"if you impose upon me the task of
equalling so accomplished and charming a lady
as Madame Sevier, you will probably be disappointed
in everything I do."</p>

<p>"Bravo, bravo, Monsieur Lesparre!" cried the
Donna; "you will certainly be successful in paying
delicate compliments, at least. Yes, Pedro,
I think you ought to secure Monsieur Lesparre's
services at once; when you have nothing for him
to do, he will be an agreeable companion for us.
What say you, Madame Sevier?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>"I quite agree with you," replied the Madame,
casting down her eyes coquettishly; "but I
prophesy that Monsieur Lesparre would find his
position an onerous one if he should be under
obligations to pay me compliments."</p>

<p>"Ah! the obligation would be unnecessary,"
said Lesparre; "the difficulty would be to avoid
doing so constantly."</p>

<p>The Don and Donna smiled at each other significantly,
thinking that they saw the incipient
signs of a mutual attachment between these two,
and that it was not unreasonable to imagine that
a wedding might result therefrom. How little
they imagined that these apparently distant acquaintances
were, in fact, already man and wife!</p>

<p>After dinner, the Don and Lesparre repaired to
the billiard-room to smoke, while the ladies entered
the drawing-room to receive visitors.</p>

<p>"Monsieur Lesparre," said the Don, as they
lounged back in luxuriant easy-chairs, "what do
you think of my suggestion at dinner? I should
really like to obtain your services as private secretary,
and I will gladly give you such a salary as
will make you independent of other labor. While
you are attending to my affairs you will naturally
become well acquainted with many business men,
and will be able to investigate a number of enterprises,
so that you will be better able a year
hence to invest your capital to advantage."</p>

<p>"Your offer is truly liberal," replied Lesparre,
puffing his cigar thoughtfully, "and I feel disposed
to accept it. What would be my duties?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I will explain what I wish fully, and
then you can judge how the position would suit
you," answered Don Pedro. "In the first place,
I wish a financial agent, a man whom I can
trust, who will attend to all my affairs. You see,
I detest the details of business. I desire to live
free from the vexing annoyances consequent
upon the providing and disbursing of money.
My estates produce as much as I can use, and I
do not trouble myself to inquire whether they
might not yield more. I am accustomed to buy
whatever I wish, but I hate to bother my head to
know whether I have enough on hand to pay for
my purchases; hence I want my secretary to attend
to such matters for me. There is another
thing in which you could be of the greatest service
to me; for, while it is an affair of great importance,
involving large interests, I am positively
too fond of my own ease to give it the
attention which it deserves. I know I can trust
you not to repeat the slightest portion of what I
am about to tell you, for it is not desirable that
it should be talked about, unless the enterprise
is successfully carried out."</p>

<p>"Indeed, you can rest assured that I shall
never mention a hint of it to any one," replied
Lesparre.</p>

<p>"Well, you recollect I told you last night that
Mather, Perkins, and some others were anxious
to have me explore and open up the diamond
fields which, I have reason to believe, constitute
a large part of one of my estates in Peru? Some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
time after I spoke to you, toward the end of the
party, I missed Mather, Perkins, McIntyre, Sanders,
and several others from the rooms, and
while I was wondering what had become of
them, Mather came up and asked me to go up to
my dressing-room, which, you recollect, adjoined
the room used for the gentlemen's dressing-room
last night. On arriving there, I found about a
dozen of the wealthiest men of Gloster sitting
around the room, with Dan McCarthy at the
table acting as secretary. Will you believe it?
They had actually formed a business meeting in
my own house, and had made speeches, passed
resolutions, and voted upon two propositions,
which they wished to submit to me; they had
then sent the chairman, Mr. Mather, to bring me
in, and I was expected to stand and deliver my
decision at a moment's notice. The idea was
perfectly ludicrous to me, yet it did not strike
any of them that they were doing anything
unusual. I believe that if a party of these Gloster
business men were to be landed suddenly in
hell, they would organize a stock exchange to
deal in brimstone and ashes!"</p>

<p>"They certainly carry their business instincts
everywhere," said Lesparre, laughing heartily.
"I suppose they had fully arranged everything
before you were sent for?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed; the very minor details were provided
for, and I could not raise an objection
which had not already been discussed and removed.
Both propositions provided for the for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>mation
of a stock company for the mining, cutting,
and sale of diamonds. According to the first
plan, I was to fix a price upon my diamond fields,
which the company would then purchase, paying
me three-fourths in cash, and one-fourth in
stock. In case, however, that I should be unwilling
to part with my controlling interest, the
second plan provided that I should receive one-fourth
the estimated value of the land in money,
giving to the company therefor the privilege of
mining for a certain length of time, and receiving
also one-half of the value of the diamonds found.
The idea of disposing of this property had never
before occurred to me, and naturally I was not
prepared to give any answer on such short notice;
but if I had done so then, I should have positively
rejected both propositions. In fact, I said as
much to Mather, and he then suggested to the
meeting that 'Señor Morito be given a week
to decide upon the propositions submitted to
him.' The cool impudence of thus graciously
giving me a week did not seem to strike them,
and the meeting broke up with great satisfaction,
every man feeling certain that I <i>must</i> accept
one proposition or the other. It was further
decided to appoint a committee to draw up a
charter and by-laws, 'so as to save time,' as one
gentleman remarked. After the gentlemen had
left the room, Mather urged the matter upon
me very strongly. He apologized for having
acted with such precipitation, but, he said, the
others were so eager, as soon as they heard that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
I owned a vast tract of unworked diamond fields,
that he could not restrain them. He begged me
to make some arrangement with the proposed
company, as the men who had become interested
in it were wealthy and enterprising, and they
would surely push it to a profitable conclusion.
In answer to my remark that I was rich enough
already, he said that I ought to give others a
chance to make some money who needed it, perhaps,
more than I. Finally, as he urged it as a
personal favor to himself, I agreed to give the
most favorable answer that I could, and so the
matter stands."</p>

<p>"When are you to give your answer?" asked
Lesparre.</p>

<p>"The committee adjourned until a week from
last night," replied the Don, "and I shall then
again be summoned before them, I presume.
Now, although the first proposition would not
probably pay me so well in the end as the second,
I much prefer it. You see I do not wish to keep
a controlling interest because I should have the
continual annoyance of supervising the business;
and, as I have said before, I wish to be perfectly
free from cares and responsibilities. My object
is to enjoy life, and I can't be happy if I am
obliged to work. Nevertheless, I do not wish to
turn over this property to a body of men who
will squeeze it like a sponge, leaving it a mere
waste. There are a large body of tenants occupying
portions of it, whose rights must be
respected. They will make willing and honest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
laborers if properly treated, and I wish to protect
them as far as possible from cruelty and extortion.
Hence, I desire to learn all I can about the
men who will create and manage the company
before I agree to put the property into their
hands, no matter what price they may be willing
to pay for it; it is here, my dear Lesparre, that
you can be of great service to me. You are well
acquainted among all classes of business men in
Gloster, and you can readily learn all about the
people who purpose buying stock. This will
be considered very natural and proper if you
become my private secretary, and your duties
will not be severe. What do you say?"</p>

<p>"I think I can do what you wish," said Lesparre,
"but I should like a day for reflection. I
never like to act hastily in an important matter,
even where my mind is already made up."</p>

<p>"You are quite right," said the Don; "but I
hope your mind will remain unchanged in regard
to this matter. I will give you whatever salary
you wish, and shall expect you, of course, to live
here on equal terms with myself and wife. Now,
let us join the ladies."</p>

<p>On receiving Lesparre's report, I saw the whole
scheme at a glance, and I was now convinced
that Senator Muirhead's suspicions with regard
to Don Pedro were correct. I immediately visited
the Senator, and laid the latest developments
before him. We could not help admiring the consummate
knowledge of human nature which the
Don displayed; he had baited his hook so skill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>fully
that the gudgeons were actually fearful lest
something should prevent them from swallowing
it; but there seemed to be no probability of defeating
his schemes unless we could obtain positive
proofs of his dishonesty elsewhere, or detect
him in some criminal offense in this country.
We therefore decided to keep a close watch upon
all his movements, and await further developments.
It was evident that the sufferers by Don
José Michel's forgeries in California would not
take any active steps against him unless they
were sure of the identity of the man, and so we
had no ground of accusation against him which
we could rely upon. Both Senator Muirhead and
myself were indignant at the audacity displayed
in his swindling projects, but we did not dare to
attempt his exposure without absolute proof of
our charges. The waiting game is never a pleasant
one to play, but I could not do otherwise
under the circumstances.</p>

<p>About this time I was called back to Chicago
on important business, but I immediately sent
my superintendent, Mr. Bangs, to Gloster, to
take charge of the case there. During my absence
little of note occurred, except the meeting
to hear the Don's answer to the propositions to
purchase the diamond fields. At this meeting
the Don was apparently anxious to decline all
offers, saying that the property had been in the
possession of his family for about two hundred
years, and that he considered himself in honor
bound to retain an interest in it. Also, he tried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
to cool the ardor of the would-be purchasers by
telling them that he had no positive certainty
that there were valuable diamond fields on the
property, though such was probably the case.
His reluctance to sell the land only made them
more determined to buy, for they argued that he
was so well satisfied with it as a means of revenue
that he wished to retain possession of it all
himself. At length he found that they would
give him no peace until he yielded, and so he
graciously agreed to accept the first proposition.
The question of price then remained to be discussed,
but, on this point, there was little opportunity
for disagreement. Having had so much
difficulty in inducing the Don to sell at all, they
were not disposed to endanger the sale by haggling
about the price; and when the latter was
fixed at one million five hundred thousand dollars,
they made no demur, although the sum
rather staggered their enthusiasm at first. This
effect was only momentary, however, for the
vivid anticipations of dividends in proportion to
this price quickly banished their fears, and they
hastened to subscribe the amounts required.
These facts were all reported to me immediately
after my return to Gloster, which occurred a day
or two after the meeting, and I saw that the day
of disaster to the trusting capitalists of that city
was fast approaching.</p>

<p>Neither Monsieur Lesparre nor Madame Sevier
had learned much about the private affairs of the
Moritos, for, whenever the latter had anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
important to say to each other, they usually
spoke Spanish. The Don's remaining funds
amounted to only about eight thousand dollars,
and at the rate with which he had hitherto spent
money, this sum would not last much more than
five or six weeks. The time might be extended
to two months by running the establishment on
credit; but the Don was averse to such a course,
and all bills were paid promptly at the end of
each month. He showed no uneasiness as his
cash began to run low, but merely said that if
the first installment on the mine should be paid
in soon, it would obviate the necessity of drawing
upon his agents in Lima, otherwise he should
call upon them for fifty thousand dollars to carry
him through the year. There was nothing in his
manner or actions to excite suspicion, and certainly,
if he intended to defraud the Diamond
Company, he had too much nerve to betray himself,
even to so close an observer as Monsieur
Lesparre.</p>

<p>Having heard the reports, I strolled out in the
evening for a walk with Mr. Bangs, and while
passing one of the leading hotels, I met a very
intimate friend, named Judge Key. The Judge
was an old resident of Gloster, and his character
was highly esteemed by all who knew him. He
was a man of great ability and force; but, possessing
little ambition, he was not nearly so well
known as many of those who were his inferiors
in point of intellect and morals. We had a great
deal of business between us at one time, and our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
relations to each other were of the most cordial
character, partaking more of the nature of personal
friendship than mere business acquaintance.
I had not visited him previously during
my stay in Gloster, for the reason that, even to
my intimate friends, I never make my presence
known when engaged in an operation, if I can
avoid doing so. On this occasion, the Judge
recognized me instantly, and greeted me with
great warmth, at the same time adding that I
was just the man above all others whom he
wished to see. He then introduced his companion
to Mr. Bangs and myself as Mr. Edward
Ashley Warne, of London, England.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Pinkerton," said the Judge, "let us
step into the club close by, and over a social glass
of wine, Mr. Warne will tell you about a peculiar
case of mistaken identity, or of consummate
rascality&mdash;it is hard to know which. Possibly
you may be able to understand some things
which puzzle us, and to frustrate a fraudulent
scheme, if our suspicions are correct. You both
know each other by reputation, I guess, and I
presume, Mr. Warne, that you will not object to
tell Mr. Pinkerton what you have told me."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, I have often heard of Mr. Pinkerton,"
said Mr. Warne, "and I think, as you say,
that he can clear up the mystery, if any one can.
I shall be pleased to tell him all that I know with
regard to it."</p>

<p>Mr. Edward Ashley Warne was an <i>attaché</i> of
the British diplomatic service, and having been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
entrusted with the settlement of some questions
relative to commerce between the United States
and Great Britain, he had executed his mission
with such fairness, good sense, and courtesy that
he was regarded with great kindness and respect
by our people as well as by his own government.
He was on a rapid tour through the United
States, previous to his return to London, and he
had spent a week in Gloster with Judge Key at
the time when we met in front of the hotel. We
were soon comfortably seated in one of the private
dining-rooms of the club, and, after a few
sips of wine, Mr. Warne began his story.</p>

<p>"I don't know whether I am the victim of
imagination, or the gentlemen of Gloster are
likely to be the victims of an impostor; but one
thing is certain, that a gentleman here known as
Don Pedro P. L. de Morito is the exact image of
a man who was known in London as Don José
Arias."</p>

<p>This information came so unawares that I almost
betrayed my interest in the case by uttering
a hasty exclamation. I restrained my feelings,
however, and asked Mr. Warne to tell me
all he knew about this man.</p>

<p>"Well, I first met him in Paris, when I was a
member of the French Legation," replied Mr.
Warne. "He was then moving in the most
aristocratic society, and his wealth was reputed
enormous. I saw a great deal of him at times,
and, indeed, I was better acquainted with him
than I was with many of my countrymen; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
was recalled to London about that time, and I
soon forgot all about Don José Arias."</p>

<p>"Pardon me," I interrupted; "was the Don
married?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes; he had a beautiful wife, I have
been told, but I never happened to see her. I
think she was Spanish, if I recollect rightly.
One day, after my return to England, as I was
entering the Foreign Office, I met Don José coming
out, and he seemed delighted to see me. He
said that he had come to spend some months in
London, and he hoped to enjoy my society frequently.
I was then engaged in studying a very
difficult diplomatic question, and I was unable to
give any time whatever to society; I therefore
expressed my regrets that I should be obliged to
decline all invitations, and, after some further
conversation, we separated. I often heard of
him in connection with social events in the best
circles, and, on one or two occasions, I met him
in the street; but I did not renew our former degree
of intimacy, for the simple reason that I did
not have the time to do so. Just before I left
London on the mission for which I had been preparing
myself, I was astonished to learn that
Don José Arias had proved to be a scoundrel of
the most dangerous character. He had not
hunted small game, it is true, but this was probably
a part of his whole scheme. So far as I
could learn, he had left no unpaid bills in the
hands of tradesmen, but he had taken enough
out of bankers and capitalists to pay his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
tradesmen's bills for half a century. The aggregate
fraudulently obtained by him was never known,
for many of his victims refused to state their
loss; but it was surmised that he obtained as
much as forty or fifty thousand pounds sterling
in London alone, while several Paris bankers also
suffered heavily. I was not specially interested
in the affair, and it had wholly passed from my
mind, when suddenly, while walking in the
streets of this city last week, I came upon Don
José Arias again. He wore his hair differently
from his old way in London and Paris, having
now full side-whiskers, whereas then he wore
only moustache and goatee; but I could not be
mistaken, and I said to Judge Key: 'There is a
man who forged paper to an immense amount in
London less than two years ago.' 'Impossible!'
replied the Judge; 'he is a very wealthy man,
moving in the best society in the city.' The
Judge then vouched for him with such earnestness
that I began to believe that I was mistaken;
but I determined to meet him face to face, to see
whether there could be two persons so nearly resembling
each other. Unfortunately he had an
opportunity to see me before I saw him when I
next met him, so that I lost the chance of surprising
him into betraying himself. He appeared
to glance at me casually, as any stranger
would do, and then went on with his conversation
without hesitation or embarrassment. I have
met him several times since then, and he always
acts with the same natural ease of manner, as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
we had always been perfect strangers to each
other; but, Mr. Pinkerton, the more I see of
him, the more fully am I convinced that Don
José Arias, of London, and Don Pedro P. L. de
Morito, of Gloster, are identical; and, believing
this, I consider it my duty to tell you these facts
in order that your citizens may be protected
against him, if possible."</p>

<p>"Well, Mr. Pinkerton," said Judge Key,
"what do you think of this affair? Mr. Warne
does not admit that he can be mistaken, and
there are some corroboratory evidences that he
may be right; yet, it seems incredible. It is a
pity that Mr. Warne should have never seen Don
José's wife, because he could then compare her
with Señora Morito, and if they, too, were exact
resemblances, there would be no longer any room
for doubt."</p>

<p>"That would certainly be a strong proof," I
remarked; "but I think it is unnecessary. The
suspicion you have spoken of, Mr. Warne, has
already been raised by another gentleman in this
city, and I have been requested to discover
whether or not it is correct."</p>

<p>"Why, you astonish me!" exclaimed Judge
Key, "for Mr. Warne has not mentioned the
subject to any one but me, and I have never even
hinted anything about it except to you gentlemen."</p>

<p>"Nevertheless, I have suspected for some time
that this Don Pedro was an impostor, and have
been trying to obtain positive proof of my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
opinion, in order to save many persons here from
being swindled by him. You are acquainted
with Senator Muirhead, Judge?"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, quite well."</p>

<p>"He has taken enough interest in the affairs
of his constituents to place in my hands the task
of exposing this man, Don Pedro, in his true
light."</p>

<p>"That seems very kind and disinterested on
the part of our Senator," said Judge Key, with a
quizzical smile; "but I will venture to say that
his interest has been excited more by the Don's
marked attentions to Mrs. Muirhead, than by the
fear that some of his constituents would be defrauded."</p>

<p>Of course I took no notice of this remark,
although I was quite convinced that such was
the fact; but as the Senator was my client, it
would have been eminently improper for me to
discuss his motives, and so I turned to Mr.
Warne.</p>

<p>"As you have already met this man under
another name, Mr. Warne," I said, "can you not
go with me to meet Senator Muirhead, and tell
him what you know about him?"</p>

<p>"I must beg you to excuse me, Mr. Pinkerton,"
he replied. "You see, I am in this country
in an official capacity, and, while I am personally
perfectly satisfied of the truth of the statements
I have made to you, I cannot prove them; hence,
I must be careful not to involve myself in a difficulty
which would compromise my position as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
diplomatic agent of Great Britain. I shall immediately
give to the police, on my arrival in London,
a description of this man, and I presume
that prompt action will be taken to insure his
arrest and extradition, in case his offenses should
come under the extradition treaty. But as this
is a question upon which the decision of both
governments may be required, the delay may
enable this man to escape. I will use all my
influence with the London authorities; you will
readily see, however, that personally I cannot
appear here as an accuser against him."</p>

<p>I recognized the force of Mr. Warne's objection,
and did not press him further, but Judge
Key agreed to visit the Senator as soon as the
latter should return to the city. When I left
Mr. Warne we had agreed that any British
official who might be sent to identify and arrest
Don Pedro, should communicate with me the
moment he arrived in this country, so that we
could work together for the same object, though
my whole duty in the case would be to protect
the interests of my client, Senator Muirhead. I
then returned to my room with Mr. Bangs, and
made a new move. I saw that more than two
months would elapse before any news could be
expected from London, as Mr. Warne would be
somewhat delayed in his return home, and meantime,
the Don would probably obtain a large
advance payment for his fictitious mines. If
anything should occur to prevent us from sending
him to England, he might succeed in getting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
away with his plunder before we could find any
new grounds upon which to hold him. I therefore
instructed Mr. Bangs to write to the proper
authorities in Peru, Brazil, and Ecuador, describing
Don Pedro and his numerous suspected
<i>aliases</i> accurately, and asking that some steps be
taken by his victims to bring him to justice. It
was true that we had no extradition treaties with
those countries, but nevertheless he might be
arrested and frightened into surrendering himself
voluntarily. The letters were dispatched at
once, and duplicates were also forwarded by the
next steamer. There remained nothing further
for me to do except to keep a strict watch upon
the Moritos to see that they should not slip off
suddenly with a large sum of money. The Diamond
Company were in such haste to bind the
bargain with Don Pedro, by making him a large
payment, that there could be no hope of preventing
the partial success of his scheme. Whether
I might not be able to force him to disgorge
afterward was uncertain, but I determined to use
every means in my power to accomplish such a
result.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>




<p class="center">CHAPTER V.
</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The third Detective is made welcome at Don Pedro's.&mdash;The
Señor is paid the first half-million dollars from
the great Diamond Company.&mdash;How Don Pedro is
"working" his Diamond Mines.&mdash;Very suspicious
preparations.&mdash;The Don describes his proposed Fête
Champêtre.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>One evening, as the members of the Morito
family were about to retire, Monsieur Lesparre
noticed a nervousness and abstraction in
Don Pedro such as he had never shown before.
Thinking that something new might be learned
by overhearing the conversation between the Don
and Donna when they should be alone, Lesparre,
instead of going to his own room, slipped into an
unused closet adjoining the Don's dressing-room,
and communicating therewith by a door, which
was kept locked. There was a transom over this
door, and, by climbing to one of the shelves,
Lesparre could hear all that was said in either
room of the Don's bedroom <i>suite</i>. He had hardly
taken this position when the two entered their
apartments.</p>

<p>"See what a handsome necklace that old fool
Mather sent me to-day," said the Donna.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is very elegant and valuable," said Don
Pedro, with a yawn; "but what we most need is
money. However, I do not imagine we shall
have any difficulty, for I expect a large sum in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
few days from the stockholders in this Diamond
Company. Still, you may as well get all you can
out of Mather and the others, for we must keep
up our present style of living to the end."</p>

<p>Just at this moment the shelf upon which Lesparre
was sitting gave a loud creak, and he had
only just time to slip down and regain his own
room before the Don came out to see what was
the matter. Fortunately, there was a large pet
cat in the hall, and she received the credit of
having made the noise.</p>

<p>The next day, on hearing Lesparre's report, I
decided to place still another detective in the
Morito mansion, and so I instructed Lesparre to
recommend the employment of a young man to
assist the butler and to do general work about
the house. As I expected, Don Pedro acquiesced
in the suggestion, and told Lesparre to engage
such men-servants as he considered necessary.
Accordingly, I at once telegraphed to Chicago to
have a young fellow named George Salter sent
to Gloster at once. He was a very intelligent
French Canadian, and I chose him because of
his slim build, his ingenuity, and his capacity as
an eavesdropper. He could listen to a conversation
with such a stolid expression that no one
would imagine he had an idea in his head beyond
the performance of his regular tasks, and even
when caught in a place where he had no right to
be, he could invent a plausible reason on the instant,
which would divert all suspicion from him.
On his arrival in Gloster, he was sent to ask em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>ployment
of Monsieur Lesparre, and, of course,
the latter was so pleased with him as to engage
him at once. He made himself very useful in
the house, and soon became popular with every
inmate.</p>

<p>A few days later a meeting of the stockholders
of the Diamond Company was held, and it was
agreed to make a payment of five hundred thousand
dollars at once, another like sum when the
title-deeds should be delivered, and the balance
within one year from that time. This arrangement
was satisfactory to the Don, and the sum
of half a million dollars was paid over that day in
the checks of the different original subscribers.
The meeting then appointed a committee of two
to visit Peru and examine the property. There
was some difficulty in selecting two gentlemen
who would be willing to go, and yet who would
be satisfactory to the others; but Deacon Humphrey
and John Preston were finally chosen.
Either of these gentlemen was willing to go anywhere
at others' expense, and it was believed
that John Preston was too well versed in fraudulent
practices to let any one else do any cheating;
hence, he was sent to investigate the mines, and
Deacon Humphrey was sent to see that John
Preston should not steal them. They were not
to depart on their mission, however, until the
title-deeds were received from Peru and delivered
to the directors.</p>

<p>Don Pedro passed the checks over to Lesparre,
and informed the meeting that he had already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
sent to Peru for the deeds, and that the directors
should be informed the moment they should arrive;
thereafter, all business matters relative to
his interest in the mines would be attended to by
Robert Harrington, Esq., who would be his attorney
in fact. The deeds would be directed to Mr.
Harrington, and that gentleman would deliver
them to the directors, receive the second payment,
and give his receipt therefor.</p>

<p>This arrangement was satisfactory to all, and
the meeting adjourned in good spirits, every man
feeling that the Don had done him a personal
favor in accepting his check in part payment for
such a valuable property.</p>

<p>The Don, having indorsed the checks, instructed
Lesparre to present them at once for
payment, each at its own bank, and to bring the
money to the house; he was to obtain as much
as possible in gold, as the Don professed to have
little confidence in the bills of private banks.</p>

<p>"They may be perfectly sound, Lesparre," he
said, in an off-hand way, "but then, you know,
we foreigners are accustomed to government
bills, or gold, and so I prefer to have the latter."</p>

<p>Taking Don Pedro's carriage, Lesparre visited
each bank, and by the time he had cashed the
last check, he had a considerable weight of gold
and a large amount of bills, about two-thirds
having been paid in coin. Lesparre and Salter
carried all the money up to the Don's dressing-room,
where the Don and Donna were sitting.</p>

<p>"There, my dear," said Don Pedro to his wife,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
"this is the first installment of the purchase
money of the diamond fields, so that now it will
not be long before they will be thoroughly worked.
The directors have promised me that you shall
have the finest diamond set that the mines can
produce within a year from this time, as a present
from the company, and you need no longer
plague me for not having tried to work them before."</p>

<p>"Oh! Pedro, how lovely!" exclaimed the
Donna; "you know I have always wanted you
to open those mines, and I am so glad that you
have consented. Now I shall have a set that I
shall be proud of."</p>

<p>"Well, I did not like to give up the old estate
to strangers, I confess," replied the Don; "but
now that it is done, I do not regret it. If you wish
any money, help yourself; you can write to your
agents in Rio that they need not send any more
for the present, for we shall have as much as we
can use for a year or two. George," he continued,
addressing Salter, "you will find a stout
iron box in the attic, and I think it will serve as
a safe for the present. Bring it down here and
put it in this room."</p>

<p>The box was soon brought, and the Don
checked off the packages of gold and bills as Lesparre
packed them away, the gold at the bottom.</p>

<p>"Now, you can check against my bank accounts
for our current expenses, Lesparre," said
Don Pedro, with a complacent smile; "and when
the funds on deposit are exhausted, I will give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
you cash monthly to pay all bills as heretofore. I
intend to give a grand <i>fête champêtre</i> soon, as a
lesson to these Gloster people how to enjoy life.
I propose to engage one of the islands in the
river at once, and begin the necessary work of
preparing it artistically for the scene of our
revelry. I shall choose one of the large wooded
islands with ridges and ravines running through
it, and it will take about two weeks to clear away
the underbrush, to clean up the grass and prepare
the landing-places. Then, by the end of another
week, the weather will be delightful, and
our arrangements will be completed. I will make
the place a fairy spectacle, such as the unimaginative
inhabitants of Gloster never dreamed
of, and then we will prepare for our summer trip
to Newport and Saratoga. What do you think
of the plan, Monsieur Lesparre?"</p>

<p>"It is an admirable one, and I feel sure that
the people of Gloster will enjoy such an entertainment
far more than any that has ever been given
here."</p>

<p>"Well, I shall rely largely upon your assistance,"
continued the Don, carefully locking his
safe as he spoke, "and we must divide the duties
between us, though of course my time will be
somewhat taken up by society. Suppose we issue
invitations for three weeks from to-day?"</p>

<p>"Better say five weeks, if not six," replied Lesparre,
anxious to delay Don Pedro's departure as
much as possible in order to obtain an answer to
our letters to Peru and Brazil. "You see, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
people here are not accustomed to such gayeties,
and it will take some time to prepare their minds
to appreciate it."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is true," said the Don, reflectively;
"but I do not like to defer it so long. However,
let us compromise by fixing one month hence as
the time, and we will make it a masquerade as
well as an outdoor <i>fête</i>. The guests will then
have ample time to prepare their costumes, and
we can give that as a reason for issuing the invitations
so long in advance."</p>

<p>The Don was in no special hurry to escape with
his plunder, but neither was he desirous of
remaining too long in the vicinity of his victims;
hence, although he had no suspicion that his
schemes had been discovered by any one, he fixed
an earlier date than that suggested by Lesparre
in order to prevent the probability of any accident
occurring to mar his plans.</p>

<p>Lesparre immediately ordered the cards of invitation,
and in a few days all Gloster was in a
state of pleasurable excitement over the news of
the coming event. Never had such a commotion
been created in the placid waters of society as
was raised by the delicate cards of invitation to
Señora Morito's <i>fête champêtre</i> and <i>bal masque</i>.
The number who received invitations was enormous,
including every individual having any
claims to be regarded as a member of good society.
From that time forward, Lesparre was so busy
with the preparations for the <i>fête</i> that he was
able to see very little of the rest of the family except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
in the evening. The Don and Donna and Madame
Sevier continued their usual round of dissipation
and gayety, however, and "all went merry as a
marriage bell."</p>

<p>Still there were some curious features of their
conduct which I regarded with suspicion. Every
day the Don gave Lesparre a large sum in bank-bills
to be exchanged for gold, and the coin was
then locked up in the iron safe. Then the Don
and Donna held frequent conversations in Spanish,
during which it was easy to see by their
manner that they were discussing an affair of
great importance. Madame Sevier found a newly-purchased
traveler's guide-book in the Donna's
bureau, and from various marks and turned
pages it was evident that it had been carefully
consulted with reference to an ocean voyage.
These things led me to the conclusion that the
Don was preparing for a journey, and the fact
that he made no mention of it, even to Lesparre,
showed that he intended to go secretly. To all
his acquaintances he spoke freely of his contemplated
tour of the watering-places during the
summer, but he always promised to spend the
following winter in Gloster, without fail; hence
it was clear that he was playing a double game,
to deceive some one. I could only wait further
developments, and heartily wish for advices from
Peru or England.</p>

<p>In company with Judge Key I called upon Senator
Muirhead, on the return of that gentleman
from the session of Congress, and we discussed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
together the best plan to pursue, to foil the
schemes of Don Pedro. The Senator was very
anxious to proceed against him immediately,
with the intention of showing him up in his true
character, and thus saving his victims from any
further loss.</p>

<p>"Indeed, Senator Muirhead," I replied, "I am
as desirous to arrest his fraudulent operations as
yourself, but I want to be sure of success before
I do anything, and I do not see my way clear to
act just now. At present we can prove nothing
whatever against him; in fact, the only charge
we could make would be that of obtaining money
under false pretenses. Now, what evidence could
we bring to substantiate the accusation? There
is no judge living that would hold him on my or
your individual opinion that he has sold mines
which do not exist, and we should have nothing
else to offer."</p>

<p>"Yes, but you forget his forgeries in other
countries," interrupted the Senator.</p>

<p>"In the first place," I replied, "you could not
charge him in this country with crimes committed
elsewhere, even though you had the positive
proof of those crimes. If you charged him
here with obtaining money under false pretenses,
you could produce no testimony except
such as bore upon the specific act alleged in your
complaint; all other testimony would be ruled
out. But, even suppose that such testimony
were admissible, can you produce any witness to
his crimes in other countries? Indeed, admitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
again that these crimes were proven, can we establish
the identity of Don Pedro P. L. de Morito
as the perpetrator of those crimes? No, sir; we
have not a single witness; I ask you as a lawyer,
Judge Key, am I not right?"</p>

<p>"You are correct in every particular, Mr.
Pinkerton," replied the Judge. "I confess that
you present the difficulties of the case more
forcibly than I could have done myself."</p>

<p>"Yes, you are right, Mr. Pinkerton," said Senator
Muirhead; "I do not see that we can do
anything; yet it seems shameful to sit idly doing
nothing, when we know that this scoundrel is
obtaining such immense sums from our people.
What do you propose to do in the future, Mr.
Pinkerton?"</p>

<p>"I can hardly tell what may be possible as
yet," I answered; "but I feel sure that I shall
not only prevent him from securing any more
plunder, but also wrest from him that which has
already fallen into his hands. He feels secure in
the possession of this large sum, and he is in no
great hurry to get away; he will undoubtedly remain
until after his <i>fête champêtre</i> at least. Before
that time, I hope to hear something definite
from either England or Peru, and then I can act
with a power in reserve in case our own means
should be insufficient to enforce our demands for
restitution. Any action against him now would
only result in hastening his departure with all
the money he has gained, for I am certain that
we could not hold him."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I see that nothing can be done now,"
said the Senator, despondently; "but do not lose
sight of this man for a moment, Mr. Pinkerton,
for he seems an adept in all the tricks of crime."</p>

<p>"Never fear, Senator Muirhead," I replied,
cheerfully; "I feel sure that we shall eventually
not only bring his career here to a hasty close,
but also recover the money which he has fraudulently
obtained."</p>

<p>When we parted, the Senator was a little more
hopeful, though he said that he should not be at
all surprised if Don Pedro outwitted us after all.
The loss to the Senator's friends would, of course,
be very large; but, perhaps, the lesson would not
be a bad thing for them; they would know better
thereafter than to part with their money so foolishly.</p>

<p>That same evening the Don and Donna, Monsieur
Lesparre, and Madame Sevier, were engaged
for the evening at a dancing party given by
Judge Peter B. Taylor. Knowing of their intentions
to attend this party, I saw an excellent opportunity
for Salter to examine the private apartments
of the Don and Donna. Accordingly,
after the family had gone away in the carriage,
Salter began to talk to the other servants about
the advantages of belonging to a family where
the domestics were allowed to do as they pleased,
instead of being so carefully watched. The laundress
then related how much less pleasure they
had, now that Madame Sevier was in charge of
the household.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why," said she, "before this French woman
came, the servants here had as good a time as
any one could ask. Many a fine ribbon, or handkerchief,
or bit of a collar, they picked up unbeknownst
to the Donna; and, as for aitin', why
there was niver a lock on any storeroom in the
house, so that there was lashins of good livin' in
the kitchen as well as in the dinin'-room. But
when this Madame Sevyay came, she put everything
under lock and key, and she snapped off
the old cook's head in no time for sassin' her.
Jist so with the men; this Lesparre, the Don's
private secretary, is as close with the men as the
Madame is with the women. The butler used
to often bring a nice bottle of wine into the
kitchen for us to be merry over, but he can't do
it now."</p>

<p>"Well, I believe I can find something to drink
by a little search," said Salter, with a knowing
wink at the laundress and chambermaid. "You
wait here, and I'll see what I can do to provide a
glass of wine all 'round.</p>

<p>"Oh! would you dare?" asked the handsome
chambermaid, looking at Salter admiringly.
"Ain't you 'fraid you'll be caught?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed; I believe I can get a bottle of port
out of one of the rooms upstairs, without any one
ever discovering its loss. Anyhow, I'm going
to try, so you all stay here while I make search."</p>

<p>Accordingly, Salter went straight to the Don's
room, to which he had a key. Having received
from Lesparre an impression of the locks of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
house several days before, I had had a skeleton
key made, which would open almost any door
about the place. While apparently engaged in
cleaning the door-knobs, it had been a very easy
matter for him to take, in wax, a complete impression
of the wards of all the door-locks, with
out attracting suspicion. He now had no difficulty,
therefore, in entering the Don's room,
where he found that the Don had removed his
iron chest from his dressing-room to his chamber,
it being placed at the head of the bedstead. On
trying to lift the box, he found that it was very
heavy indeed, requiring all his strength to stir it.
This was due, of course, to the coin which had
been put into it, and Salter's testimony, therefore,
corroborated Lesparre's. Salter then, in accordance
with my instructions, carefully bored holes
through the door leading into the closet in which
Lesparre had once listened to a short conversation
between the Don and Donna. He arranged these
holes so that they would not be detected by the
eye, and having thus prepared an excellent place
for listening to the occupants of the chamber
suite, Salter returned to the kitchen. On the
way, he opened the dining-room sideboard and
captured a bottle of port wine, with which he entertained
the other servants in fine style.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Don and his party had been
received with the utmost cordiality by Judge
Taylor and his wife, who felt quite proud to be
the first to entertain such distinguished guests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
after the sale of the diamond mines, and the issue
of the invitations to the Don's grand <i>fête</i>.</p>

<p>Every one had talked about the affair, but no
one felt exactly sure what a <i>fête champêtre</i> was,
and so United States Commissioner Charlie Morton
determined to ask the Don himself what his
entertainment would be. Accordingly, as Don
Pedro approached with Mrs. Arlington on his
arm, Morton greeted him pleasantly, and said:</p>

<p>"Don Pedro, every one who has received an
invitation to your <i>fête champêtre</i> is dying of curiosity
to know what it means, and so I am going
to take the liberty of asking you to explain it. I
freely confess my own ignorance, and I know
that there are a great many others no better informed
than I am, who would be ashamed to admit
that fact; but I cheerfully acknowledge that
I have never attended one, and I don't know how
I shall be expected to dress nor to act. So please
tell me all about it, and I will promise to spread
the news among my acquaintances."</p>

<p>"My dear sir," replied Don Pedro, politely, "I
admire your frankness, and I shall take pleasure
in explaining the principal features of our <i>fête
champêtre</i>. It was the Donna Lucia's desire and
mine to devote one day to enjoyment, and we
therefore decided upon giving an entertainment
in the open air which should combine every
species of gayety and social recreation. It is our
intention to embark in the forenoon and proceed
by steamer to one of the large islands in the river.
There everything will be prepared for outdoor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a><br /><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>enjoyment; there will be boats and bathing-houses;
swings and archery-grounds; billiard-tables
and bowling-alleys; in short, opportunities
will be provided for the gratification of every
one's tastes. About five o'clock a dinner will be
served, the <i>menu</i> for which will include every
procurable luxury of the table, and after dinner,
the evening will be spent in dancing on the open
platforms or in enclosed ballrooms, according to
the preferences of the guests, while magnesium
lights and colored lanterns will give all possible
brilliancy to the scene. Dazzling displays of fireworks
will be given at intervals during the evening,
and when we finally leave the island on our
return to the city, a grand illumination of the
whole island will take place as we steam off into
the darkness."</p>

<p>[Illustration: <i>Don Pedro explaining the Fête Champêtre.</i>]</p>

<p>Quite a group had gathered around while the
Don was speaking, and as he closed, there was a
general murmur of admiration. The whole
affair was planned on a scale of such magnificence
as to appear almost too wonderful to be believed,
but the Don had shown such fertility of
invention previously, that there was no doubt he
was quite equal to creating a scene of oriental
splendor such as had never before been witnessed
in this country.</p>

<p>"Well, I admit frankly," said Charlie Morton,
"that we Americans must learn the art of enjoying
life from foreigners, and I think there is no
doubt that Don Pedro is a most adept master of
its mysteries. Is there not something said in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
invitations about appearing in masks, Don
Pedro?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I forgot to say at first that there
will be much amusement in requiring every
guest to be dressed in fancy costume and to wear
a mask. The masks will not be removed until
the dinner is served, and then, at a given signal,
the guests will expose themselves in their own
characters."</p>

<p>The Don's description of the intended programme
for the <i>fête</i> was soon repeated through
all the fashionable circles of Gloster, and the expectation
of the whole city was raised to a high
pitch. No other social event had ever created a
like excitement, and it was the theme of conversation
at all times and in all places.</p>

<p>The day following the Taylor's party Don
Pedro seemed to have determined to get rid of as
much paper money in exchange for gold as possible,
and during the day he sent more than
twenty thousand dollars to be exchanged; of this
amount Lesparre and Madame Sevier handled the
greater portion, but even the young man, Salter,
was entrusted with three thousand dollars in
paper, for which he obtained gold at a trifling
discount. This method of exchanging money
was repeated several times, it being evidently the
Don's intention to retain nothing but gold in his
possession, and as he had already obtained the
greater portion of his plunder in coin, it was not
long before he had accomplished his object.</p>

<p>Meantime, the preparations for the <i>fête</i> went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
on apace, and the time of the Don and Lesparre
was quite fully occupied in planning and arranging
the details. The Senator called to see me
daily, and his constant urging somewhat excited
me, so that I became nervous and apprehensive
myself. Still, no news came from abroad, and I
could do nothing.</p>




<p class="center">CHAPTER VI.
</p>

and his unpalatable Reminiscences.&mdash;The

<p>"Early one forenoon Salter was called to the
front door by a violent pull at the bell, and
on arriving there he confronted a rather disreputable-looking
character, who eyed him with an
extremely distrustful look. The man appeared
to be about thirty years old, and he was evidently
a foreigner. He was tall, well-formed, and muscular,
and his general bearing was quite at variance
with his ragged, dirty clothing. He had black
hair and moustache, a swarthy complexion, small
feet and hands, the latter soft and well-shaped,
and his dark eyes were piercing and brilliant.</p>

<p>"Good morning," he said to Salter, with a
haughty nod; "is Don Juan at home?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"No such person lives here," replied Salter,
partially closing the door upon the wolfish-appearing
stranger.</p>

<p>"I have good reasons for believing that Don
Juan <i>is</i> here," replied the man, "and is doubtless
the guest of the gentleman who resides here. At
any rate, I know that he is now in this house,
and I want to see him very much. He would be
equally glad to see me if he knew I were here;"
and so saying, he pushed Salter aside and entered
the hall.</p>

<p>This action still further prejudiced Salter against
him, and he said:</p>

<p>"Perhaps you mean Monsieur Lesparre, who is
a guest of my employer?"</p>

<p>"That may be," replied the man; "please say
that I wish to see him immediately."</p>

<p>Salter did not care to leave the stranger alone,
and so he told one of the female servants, who was
dusting the parlor furniture, to call Monsieur
Lesparre. That gentleman was in Don Pedro's
room, discussing some plans for the <i>fête</i>, and,
when informed that a stranger wished to see
him, he told the servant to show him to the
room where he usually transacted business. As
the man passed before Don Pedro's door, however,
Lesparre stepped out to learn who it was.</p>

<p>"This man wishes to see you, Monsieur Lesparre,"
said Salter, who was following the stranger.</p>

<p>"That is not the gentleman I asked for," the
latter replied.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>At this instant Don Pedro came into the hall,
and, as his eyes fell upon the stranger, he gave a
sudden start, and became very pale. The recognition
was mutual, for the newcomer rushed
forward and said:</p>

<p>"Ah! Don Juan, I am delighted to meet you
again. I knew I was not mistaken when I saw
you yesterday and recognized&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, there!" interrupted the Don, giving
the speaker a warning look, "I am glad to meet
you again, Pietro; walk into my room, and sit
down."</p>

<p>Lesparre was about to follow, but Don Pedro
stopped, and whispered to him:</p>

<p>"Excuse me a short time, my dear Lesparre;
this is an old acquaintance whom I knew in better
circumstances years ago. He seems quite reduced
now, and he may be sensitive enough to
object to telling the story of his loss of fortune
before a stranger;" and, so saying, the Don
retired to his room, leaving Lesparre and Salter
outside.</p>

<p>The latter immediately hurried into the closet,
where he could hear the whole conversation
within the room.</p>

<p>"Well, Pietro," began the Don, "where are
you from? You have not been fortunate, it is
evident; but how did it happen?"</p>

<p>"You are right; I have had bad luck," replied
Pietro. "It is the old story; I have had thousands
of dollars at times, and have lived like a
prince; and again I have been badly treated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
Dame Fortune, and have lived as I could; but I
have never before been so very miserable and
poor as now. Positively, it is most providential
that I have met you, for I have eaten nothing for
twenty-four hours."</p>

<p>"Indeed, Pietro, you shock me," replied the
Don, sympathetically; "shall I order some breakfast
for you?"</p>

<p>"No; I can wait awhile, and I do not care to be
seen by your servants until I get better clothing.
But tell me where you have been since we parted
in Peru. You have certainly been as fortunate
as I have been the reverse; do you make much by
gambling?"</p>

<p>"No, Pietro; I gamble very little, except in an
occasional game of cards with gentlemen of my
acquaintance; but I made a good sum&mdash;that is,"
continued the Don, checking himself a moment,
"I made a wealthy marriage, and my wife's fortune
is ample for us both. By the way, how did
you happen to find me?"</p>

<p>"Well, I have been enjoying life in New Orleans
for some time, and, having won quite a
large amount there, I decided to come North as
the mild weather began. So I started a month
ago on one of those enormous Mississippi steamboats,
and, of course, I gambled whenever I could.
My luck was bad from the start, and, on arriving
here, I had nothing except my clothing and
jewelry; these I pawned gradually, and soon I
was reduced to my present condition. Yesterday
I met you as you were entering the Globe Hotel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
with a party of gentlemen, but I did not want to
mortify you by speaking to you in company; so I
waited until you came to this house, intending
then to call upon you late in the evening, when
no one would see me; but you went out in your
carriage, and remained so late, that I put off my
visit until this morning. I thought that, considering
our former relations to each other, you
would be willing to set me on my feet again."</p>

<p>"I shall be very glad indeed to do so," replied
the Don, eagerly, "and you must tell me what
you wish to do, and where you wish to go."</p>

<p>"Well, just now I should like to go to breakfast,
Don Juan," said Pietro, with a gaunt smile;
"but I have no money to pay for my meal."</p>

<p>"Don't call me 'Don Juan,' my dear friend,"
said the Don. "I have adopted another name
for use in this country, and of course no one
knows me except as Don Pedro P. L. de Morito."</p>

<p>"Oh, ho! is that all there is of it?" asked
Pietro, with a laugh. "Well, I shall remember
in future to call you 'Don Pedro'; but what
can you do for me in the way of money and
clothes?"</p>

<p>"I will give you fifty dollars at once, and you
can get a new outfit yourself; then, when you
call again to-morrow morning, we will talk over
your future plans. I have a very important
engagement to keep in about fifteen minutes, so I
must ask you to excuse me now."</p>

<p>"But I can't get any respectable suit of clothes
and underclothing for fifty dollars," replied
Pietro.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, here are fifty dollars," said the Don
handing a roll of bills to Pietro, "and my secretary,
Monsieur Lesparre, will give you an equal
amount. You will then have enough to satisfy
your immediate wants, and we will arrange the
rest to-morrow."</p>

<p>So saying, the Don called Monsieur Lesparre
and introduced the stranger as Pietro Bernardi, a
fellow-countryman in distress. The Don was
quite pale and nervous, and though he did not
show any marked signs of agitation, a close
observer, like Lesparre, could readily see that his
new visitor was anything but a welcome one.</p>

<p>"I wish you to give Señor Bernardi fifty dollars,
Monsieur Lesparre," said the Don, "and
order breakfast for him here, if he wishes it. I
am going out immediately, as I see the carriage
is waiting for me, but I shall return at lunch-time.
<i>Au revoir</i>, gentlemen; call about nine
o'clock to-morrow, Pietro."</p>

<p>The Don then went to his carriage, and Pietro
followed Lesparre to his business-room, where he
received an additional fifty dollars. Pietro
quickly stowed the money away in his pocket,
and walked abruptly out of the house, saying:</p>

<p>"I'll not trouble you to prepare breakfast for
me, as I can get it down town just as well."</p>

<p>The moment Pietro was gone, Lesparre called
Salter out of the closet, and sent him out on an
errand ostensibly; of course, his real duty was to
"shadow" Mr. Pietro Bernardi, and report the
occurrences of the morning to me. Salter kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
his man in view until he was seated at a popular
restaurant table, and then, knowing that some
time would be required before the Peruvian's appetite
would be satisfied, my detective hurried to
my office, and made his report. As it would not
be safe to detain Salter long away from his
duties at the Morito residence, I decided to keep
a watch upon Bernardi myself until Mr. Bangs
could send me a man from Chicago. Having
sent a telegram to Mr. Bangs, I went to the restaurant
at once, being joined by Judge Key on
the way. Together we entered the restaurant,
and I quickly discovered Bernardi still lingering
over his breakfast. We each ordered a cup of
coffee, and I informed the Judge of the new developments
in the case as brought out in the conversation
between the Don and Bernardi.</p>

<p>"My opinion is," I said, in a tone audible only
to the Judge, "that this man, Bernardi, knows
some important facts relative to the past life of
Don Pedro, and if we can pump this information
out of him, we may thereby obtain valuable assistance
in our endeavors to outwit the Don.
Now it shall be my aim to learn all that this man
knows, for it may give us the means of proceeding
against Señor Morito immediately; but even
if it should not, we may need such information
very much. You see, it is not impossible that
we may be forced to use threats to make him disgorge,
for I shall not let him escape with his
plunder without a struggle, even though no news
whatever should come from Peru or England. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
present, however, we will devote some time to
this Pietro Bernardi, and see what he can tell
us."</p>

<p>The Judge fully concurred with me, and said
that, as I might be too busy to see Senator Muirhead,
he would call upon that gentleman and tell
him the latest news. We accordingly sipped our
coffee slowly until Bernardi was ready to go, and
then I followed him at a little distance, while the
Judge went to call upon Senator Muirhead.</p>

<p>Bernardi slowly sauntered down the street, smoking
a cigar, and soon reached a large retail clothing
store. I remained in the street watching the
entrance of the store about an hour, when, as I
expected, Bernardi came out in a neat business
suit complete, but wearing the same old boots and
hat. These articles were soon replaced by new
ones, and after a bath and shave, Señor Bernardi
was a very different-looking person from the
rough customer who had visited Don Pedro in the
morning. In addition to his underclothing, linen,
hat, boots, and suit of clothes, he purchased at a
pawnbroker's shop some very decent jewelry and
he now appeared like a gentlemanly gambler, or
a member of the Board of Trade. He did not
conclude his business arrangements until he had
engaged a boarding-place and bought a trunk,
which was sent to his lodgings. He then appeared
to have relieved his mind of all care, and
he spent the afternoon playing pool and billiards
in a fashionable saloon. After dining at a restaurant,
he went to a minstrel entertainment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
after which he returned to his lodgings to retire
for the night. When I went to bed at eleven
o'clock, after having followed Bernardi most of
the day, I realized that the duties of a faithful
"shadow" were sometimes excessively wearying.</p>

<p>The next morning, however, I found that a Mr.
Newton had arrived from Chicago in response to
my telegram, and I was thus relieved from any
further anxiety. He was a cool, shrewd fellow,
of attractive appearance and pleasing manners,
so that he was peculiarly fitted to obtain the confidence
of a man like Bernardi, and it was on that
account that I had selected him for the work.
He had no difficulty in tracking Bernardi to Don
Pedro's residence, and having seen him admitted
there, Newton hurried back to report to me. I
then instructed him to follow Bernardi until he
should have an opportunity to make his acquaintance;
this could be done without difficulty in a
drinking or billiard saloon, and he was then to
cultivate an intimacy with him.</p>

<p>On asking to see Señor Morito, Bernardi was at
once admitted, and as soon as the Don closed his
door, Salter slipped into the closet to listen.</p>

<p>"Ah! you are looking much better this morning,"
said the Don, as he scratched a match and
handed it to Bernardi to light his cigar.</p>

<p>"Yes, I am feeling much better too. This
seems quite like old times, doesn't it? As I sit
here and puff your fragrant Havanas, I could almost
imagine you were again in the real estate
business in Peru. Ha! ha! that was a speculation
that paid well, eh?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pietro, you must be careful not to drop a
hint of those times to any one, or I should be
ruined," replied the Don; "I am in good society
here, and I hope to make a little money out of a
scheme I have on hand; but it is still quite
uncertain whether I shall succeed, and my
expenses in engineering the affair are fast eating
up all my capital. Now, I shall be happy to
assist you as far as I can, but it will be on condition
that you leave town; for if you should get
tipsy and begin to talk about me, I should lose
everything. Next month, I may realize my
hopes, but I am playing a risky game, and I cannot
afford to jeopardize it. What do you want?
Tell me how I can serve you, and how much
money you need, and if I can help you, I will
gladly do so."</p>

<p>"That is fair enough, Don Juan&mdash;Pedro, I
mean&mdash;I only want a start, and I shall get along
without any difficulty; but to tell the truth, I
don't know where to go. I could not return to
Peru&mdash;neither could you, for that matter&mdash;and I
know of only one place where I could succeed
and be satisfied to stay. I have been thinking of
going to Buenos Ayres, if I could have a fair sum
to start me in good style on arriving there; but
it is a long journey, and I am in no haste to start.
By the way, where is your present señorita? or
are you really married as you said? Is she as
handsome as the other was?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she is very handsome," replied the Don,
curtly; "but she knows nothing about my his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>tory
previous to our meeting, and I do not wish
that she should; so let us leave her out of our
discussion. I have some money left, though it is
decreasing rapidly, and I will assist you as far as
possible, if you will leave Gloster at once; for I
am afraid that you will begin drinking to excess
again, and you know that when you are half
drunk there is nothing in the world you will not
tell. How much do you want?"</p>

<p>"Oh! Don Pedro, you need not fear that I
shall betray you; but I can't start off on a long
journey so soon after the fatigue and hardship I
have undergone during the last month. Just let
me have three or four hundred dollars to enable
me to live in good style for a week or two, and
to get some better jewelry than this cheap stuff,
and I will be ready to start for Buenos Ayres as
soon as you wish."</p>

<p>"Well, I will give you three hundred dollars
now, and as soon as you have spent that, you
must be ready to leave Gloster on your way out
of the United States."</p>

<p>So saying, the Don stepped to his dressing-case,
opened and then closed a drawer, and said:</p>

<p>"There are three rouleaux of gold pieces, each
containing one hundred dollars. When that is
gone, I will buy your ticket to Buenos Ayres or
Montevideo, as you prefer, and will give you as
much money as I can possibly spare; you must
be prepared to go then."</p>

<p>"All right, my dear Pedro," replied Bernardi,
rising to go; "I shall be ready at that time. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
can trust my discretion, however, as long as I
stay here, and no one shall ever hear a word
from me to your discredit. I may call to see you
occasionally?"</p>

<p>"Oh! certainly; come in the forenoon. By the
way, Pietro, let me caution you against gambling
while you are here, for I have found that we are
no match for these Northern gamblers. They
will take every dollar from you if you venture to
stake against them. You will surely lose, and
then you will want me to supply you again; but
I tell you frankly I will not do it. I have hardly
money enough to carry through my scheme, and
if you choose to betray me, you can do so, but it
won't do you any good whatever; whereas, if you
are faithful to me, I can spare you a reasonable
sum to start you afresh in Buenos Ayres."</p>

<p>"Never fear, Don Pedro, I shall be mute as an
oyster," and so saying, Bernardi took his leave.</p>

<p>The foregoing conversation had taken place in
the Don's dressing-room, so that Salter had no
difficulty in hearing every word, even when the
speakers dropped their voices to mere whispers;
but there was another listener in the Don's bed-chamber
who was equally successful in overhearing
all that had been said. The Donna, having
heard of the arrival of this mysterious Pietro
Bernardi the day before, was anxious to know
who he was and what he came for. Accordingly,
she placed herself at the keyhole of their chamber
door leading into the Don's dressing-room,
and when Pietro had gone, she entered the Don's
presence.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who was that person, Don Pedro?" she
asked, with a sharp tone to her voice, foreboding
no good to her already nervous and irritated
spouse.</p>

<p>"Oh! his name is Pietro Bernardi, and I formerly
knew him in Peru. He was quite a fine
young fellow then, but he has taken to gambling,
drinking, and general dissipation, so that it
is very unpleasant to have him turn up here as
an acquaintance."</p>

<p>"Is that the only reason why you dislike to see
him, Señor Morito?" asked the Donna, her
manner becoming more clearly inquisitive and
hostile. "You are too anxious to get rid of him for
that to be the sole cause of your annoyance at his
presence."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear Lucia, the fact is, that he
knows enough about me in the past to be a very
dangerous person to have around just now, for
he might expose me to the people here, and ruin
our schemes upon the Diamond Company."</p>

<p>"Why did you not tell me about this? There
must be no secrets which I do not share, for I do
not intend to be deserted by you as you have deserted
others before. No, no, Don Pedro," she
continued, passionately, "I heard every word of
your conversation with this man, and you must
understand that you cannot treat me like a doll,
to be thrown away when you are tired of me.
I am able and anxious to help you in all your
plans, but I must have your full confidence. You
know that I love you, and you say that you re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>turn
my love, but sometimes I distrust you. You
deserted a señorita in Lima, and some day you
may try to desert me; but I warn you that I
would follow you to the ends of the earth, and I
could easily find it in my heart to kill you if you
played me false."</p>

<p>As the Donna uttered these words, her determined
tones clearly showed that she would have
no hesitation in executing her threat. The Don
had no reply to offer, and finally the Donna
closed the conversation by saying:</p>

<p>"This is our first approach to a quarrel, and I
hope it will be the last. You know that I am
fearfully excited by any suggestion of the possibility
of losing you, and this man's words and
sneers have made me almost beside myself. But
recollect, I am not without friends, for there are
plenty of rich men here who would be delighted
to obey my lightest whims if I would permit
them, and if you should ever desert me, I would
tell all I know of you, and invoke their aid to
bring you to punishment. Now let us go along
together, without any secrets apart from each
other in the future, and we shall have no occasion
to quarrel again."</p>

<p>The Donna then left the room, and went out to
drive with Madame Sevier, leaving the Don
alone. Salter quickly slipped downstairs, but
was summoned back by the ringing of the Don's
bell. On entering the dressing-room, Salter found
his employer seated in a large easy-chair, looking
quite pale and agitated.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish you would bring me a decanter of
brandy and a glass, George," said the Don; "I
don't feel very well, and I think a sip of cognac
will do me good."</p>

<p>Salter obeyed orders, and then went to Lesparre's
room to report the conversations which
he had overheard while concealed in the closet.
Lesparre soon went into the Don's room to talk
over the plans for the <i>fête</i>, but Don Pedro was in
low spirits, and did not care to converse. He ordered
his horse to be brought to the door, and
was soon galloping down the avenue as a relief
to his depressed nerves. Lesparre immediately
came to my office, reported what Salter had told
him, and then went about his duty of preparing
the island to receive the guests on the day of the
<i>fête</i>.</p>

Friends.&mdash;A "Tête-à-Tête" worth One Thousand
Dollars.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>When Pietro Bernardi left the Morito residence,
he sauntered downtown in a
leisurely manner, with Newton carefully following
at a safe distance. Bernardi was evidently
vain of his personal appearance, for he was dissatisfied
with his ready-made outfit, and, entering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
a fashionable tailoring establishment, he was
measured for a complete suit of clothes. The
rest of the forenoon was spent in buying shirts,
underclothing, trinkets, and toilet articles of quite
an expensive character. After a hasty lunch at
a restaurant, Bernardi walked to the post-office,
where he met a man whose appearance indicated
unmistakably the professional gambler. They
seemed to be old acquaintances, and, after taking
a drink together, they conversed for some time
in low tones. Finally they separated, and Bernardi
went to his lodgings. About six o'clock he
reappeared, and Newton followed him to the
post-office again, where the gambler, who was
waiting in the morning, was met apparently by
appointment. The two men walked a short distance
together, and then disappeared up a stairway,
which, Newton was certain, led to gambling
rooms. He waited outside nearly an hour undecided
what to do, but at length he went upstairs
among a crowd of young sports, who seemed to
know the ways of the place, and he was allowed
to pass in with them unquestioned. He found
Bernardi just rising from the dinner-table, which
the proprietors of the gambling house were in
the habit of setting for their regular patrons.
The faro-table was in full blast, and Bernardi
was soon seated at it with the air of an old
<i>habitué</i>. He was thenceforward so deeply interested
in the game as to pay no attention to anything
else, and, as he was unusually lucky, his
pile of gold pieces rapidly increased. Newton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
took a position at his elbow and watched the
game in silence for some minutes. At length,
seeing Bernardi win a large stake, he said in a
familiar tone:</p>

<p>"You are unusually lucky to-night, and I see
you play for all the game is worth."</p>

<p>Keeping his eyes intently fastened upon the
dealer's box, Bernardi replied carelessly:</p>

<p>"Yes, this is a game where a man must put
down his money freely if he wants to win."</p>

<p>The next turn of the cards was doubly lucky
for Bernardi, and, as he raked in his winnings,
he glanced up at Newton, scanned his face a moment,
and said:</p>

<p>"I think I have met you in New Orleans, have
I not?"</p>

<p>"Very likely, for I have often been there; but
I do not recall your name, though your face is
quite familiar to me."</p>

<p>"Why, certainly," continued Bernardi, apparently
quite pleased at the idea of meeting an old
New Orleans acquaintance; "my name is Pietro
Bernardi, and I have often seen you in the rooms
of French Joe on Magazine street."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, I used to go there a good deal, and
we must have met frequently. Let us take something
for old acquaintance' sake."</p>

<p>This was taking a short cut to Bernardi's friendship,
and as the two stood before the sideboard
clicking glasses together, a stranger would have
supposed them to be old cronies, as indeed Bernardi
actually believed to be the case. Newton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
instantly saw that Bernardi's frequent drinks during
the day and his later potations in the evening
had rendered him somewhat intoxicated; he was
not drunk, for he had a perfect comprehension of
his actions, but he had drunk enough to be very
happy, and he probably saw in Newton's face a
hazy resemblance to some one he had known
in New Orleans. He soon returned to the faro-table,
and, taking his seat, asked Newton whether
he intended to do any betting.</p>

<p>"No, not to-night," Newton replied, yawning.
"I am very tired and restless, and I make it a
rule never to bet when my nerves are shaky."</p>

<p>"Well, that is a mighty good rule," said Bernardi,
as he put out a pile of gold pieces. "If
you will only stick to that plan, you will be sure
to win. I can always feel when luck is with me,
and if I could only make up my mind to stop
when I know that I cannot win, I should be as
successful as could be wished; but sometimes I
get obstinate when the cards begin to run against
me, and then I buck against fate until I lose all."</p>

<p>Having an absorbing interest in the game, Bernardi
talked very little after this, but about eleven
o'clock he counted his winnings, and, finding that
they amounted to more than two hundred dollars,
he decided to withdraw. In company with
Newton, therefore, he left the room, and entered
a bar-room below. They drank and chatted together
a short time, and then separated, Bernardi
going to a well-known house of ill-repute, while
Newton carefully dogged his footsteps unseen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Knowing that Bernardi intended to spend the
night where he was, Newton returned to his own
lodgings. They had agreed to meet at the post-office
about eleven o'clock next day, and Newton
knew that his services would not be required before
that hour.</p>

<p>About eleven o'clock in the forenoon, Newton
and Bernardi met at the post-office, as agreed,
and, after a morning dram together, they went
to a restaurant for breakfast.</p>

<p>"How did you enjoy yourself yesterday evening?"
asked Newton, as they were finishing their
meal.</p>

<p>"Oh! very well indeed. I met a young lady
whom I used to know in New Orleans, and she
was very lovely; but I shall never meet one like
my señorita. She was the most beautiful woman
living;" and, as he spoke, Bernardi sighed deeply,
and became moody, silent, and abstracted.</p>

<p>"Yes; I recollect having seen her with you
once in New Orleans," replied Newton, on a venture;
"is she dead?"</p>

<p>"No, &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; her! I wish she was," replied
Bernardi, savagely. "She started to come North
with me, and I gave her everything she could ask;
but when I had won a large sum of money at Natchez,
she stole several thousand dollars from me,
and disappeared with a Mississippi gambler, whom
she had never seen but twice. I didn't care for
the money, but I loved her passionately, and I
cannot think of her without becoming enraged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Come, let us go get some brandy; I always have
to drink when I think of her."</p>

<p>While they were drinking together, Newton
asked Bernardi if he was always fortunate in
gaming.</p>

<p>"Oh! no, indeed; why, less than a week ago I
had not a cent to buy my breakfast, and I did not
know whether to enlist in the army or commit
suicide."</p>

<p>"Then your present success is marvelous, for
you must have won, in all, four or five hundred
dollars," said Newton, inquiringly.</p>

<p>"No, I did not win it all; in fact, I could not
have done so, for I did not have a dime to start
with; but I met an old friend here who gave me
a few hundreds, and who will give me more
when I want it."</p>

<p>"That's the kind of a friend to have," said
Newton, warmly; "come, let us drink again to
his health. I wish I had met you before, for I
would have been glad to divide with you. We
ought always to stand by each other, especially
we Southerners, among these Yankee gamblers."</p>

<p>"Yes, that is true," replied Bernardi, taking
an immense drink of brandy; "they are not so
generous to each other as we are down South.
Now, my friend, whom I spoke of, is one of the
right sort. He gave me enough for a new
outfit, and has promised to give me a good sum
when I am ready to go South again."</p>

<p>"Is he a Southerner too?" asked Newton.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," Bernardi replied, "he is from Peru,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
where I first met him, and we have had many
a gay time together. I used to keep a fine
suite of gambling rooms, which he frequented,
and he used to play with the utmost indifference
to the results; he always seemed equally unmoved
whether he won or lost."</p>

<p>"I suppose you must have been very warm
friends," said Newton, "or he would not now be
so ready to assist you?"</p>

<p>"Well, Don Juan is a very liberal fellow, I
admit," answered Bernardi; "but he might not
be so generous were it not to his interest to be
so," he continued, with a knowing wink.</p>

<p>"Oh! ho! I see," replied Newton, nodding his
head expressively. "Your friend would not care
to have you talk about his past history, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Exactly; he knows that I could tell some
things about him which might spoil his pleasure
here, and so he is anxious to keep on good terms
with me. However, he needn't fear me as long
as he treats me decently, for I do not wish to
injure him, and when I am ready to go I shall
get a good sum from him to start me in business
elsewhere."</p>

<p>"Suppose he should refuse to give you anything
more, or have you arrested for blackmailing
him," suggested Newton.</p>

<p>"I'd like to see him try it," Bernardi exclaimed,
with a volley of oaths. "I guess two
could play at the game of swearing out warrants,
and when the account was balanced, his impris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>onment
would be twenty times as long as mine.
No, no; I have no fear that he will attempt such
a thing."</p>

<p>"I merely spoke of it as a possibility," said
Newton, "in order that you should be on your
guard. A man with wealth and position might
succeed in crushing a friendless poor man in
spite of the latter's protestations. However, if
any such thing should happen, you can depend
upon it that I will work for you until you are
released."</p>

<p>"That's right, my friend," replied Bernardi, as
he called for another drink of brandy. "If I
should suddenly disappear without warning to
you, don't fail to search for me everywhere, and
I will see that you are handsomely rewarded. If
Don Juan should attempt any treachery, I should
have him at my mercy as soon as I should get
free, and, together, we could squeeze a large
sum out of him."</p>

<p>Newton spent the day with Bernardi, and they
became quite inseparable. After driving about
the city for an hour or two, they attended a matinée
performance at one of the theatres, and then
had a long and sumptuous dinner at a fashionable
restaurant. In the evening they went to the
gambling-rooms where they had met the night
before, and Bernardi was soon absorbed in the
game of faro. His luck still clung to him, and,
on leaving the place at midnight, he had won
three hundred dollars more. As before, Bernardi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
went to enjoy the society of his New Orleans
charmer, and Newton went to his own lodgings.</p>

<p>After Newton had made his report to me, early
the next morning, I told him to continue his intimacy
with Bernardi, and to pump him as thoroughly
as possible relative to Don Pedro's past
history. Soon after his departure to meet Bernardi,
Senator Muirhead and Judge Key entered,
and we discussed the possibility of doing anything
with this new witness, Pietro Bernardi.</p>

<p>"Would it not be possible to frighten him into
telling all he knows of Don Pedro?" asked the
Senator.</p>

<p>"I hardly think we could," I replied. "In the
first place, you have no charge whatever against
Bernardi, nor any reason to suppose that he has
ever been a criminal anywhere; hence, how could
we frighten him? Moreover, he is a man of considerable
nerve, and he would see that, as against
third parties, his interests would be best served
by supporting, instead of attacking, Don Pedro.
No, I don't see anything to be gained as yet by
showing our hands. Our object is to recover
possession of the money paid to the Don for
those bogus diamond fields, and to do that, we
must wait until we have a sure case against him
for his crimes committed elsewhere."</p>

<p>"I agree with you wholly," added Judge Key.
"Besides, this fellow, Bernardi, knows nothing
of the Don's forgeries and frauds except those
committed in Peru, and as we have before shown,
we could make no use of those accusations until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
we hear from Peru. Indeed, it is questionable
how far we can proceed even then, for we have
no extradition treaty with that country."</p>

<p>"Well, I do not mind that very much," I
replied, "for my chief dependence is upon the
moral effect upon Don Pedro. I think that we
can so work upon him as to obtain his consent to
go to Peru voluntarily, rather than to be detained
here until a requisition arrives from England.
He knows that if he be sent to England, he will
be transported for a long term of years; whereas,
in Peru, he may avoid conviction altogether, or
purchase his escape after conviction."</p>

<p>"But can we make him give up his plunder?"
asked the Senator, anxiously.</p>

<p>"I think we can," said I. "You see that he is
liable to be held here for obtaining money under
false pretenses, and during the trial the money
could be taken by attachment. Then, even
though he should not be convicted, the delay
would enable us to make sure of sending him back
to London, where a heavy sentence would undoubtedly
be given him. Now, by representing
these things to him, we shall induce him to hand
over the money voluntarily, and after that we
shall not care whether he is taken to Great Britain
or Peru."</p>

<p>"If that be the case, why not arrest him now
and get the advices from London afterward?"
asked the Senator, who was very anxious to
hasten matters.</p>

<p>"Because we could not present a sufficient case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
to hold him under the preliminary examination,"
replied Judge Key. "When we get official news
of the fellow's character from Peru, we shall
have a sure thing against him, and then I shall
feel ready to act; but I agree with Mr. Pinkerton
that there would be danger in overhaste. You
see, we have him carefully watched, and there is
no probability that he intends to make off until
after this <i>fête champêtre</i>; therefore, let us wait
for our foreign advices as long as we can, and in
case he prepares to go before they arrive, it will
be time enough to arrest him then."</p>

<p>"How about the Donna?" asked Muirhead.
"Do you propose to take any steps against her?"</p>

<p>"I don't see how we can," I replied. "With
the exception of the sums she has received from
Mather, she has obtained nothing fraudulently;
and, as you may well suppose, we could never
get Mather to testify against her; so I guess we
need not trouble ourselves to interfere with the
lovely Donna at all."</p>

<p>Our conference then broke up with the understanding
that we should assemble again the
moment any new facts in the case should be
developed. Just after the gentlemen had left,
Madame Sevier came in and reported a scene
between Mather and the Donna which had taken
place the previous evening.</p>

<p>The Don had remained at home entertaining
various guests until nine o'clock. He had then
gone out with Lesparre and several other gentlemen,
to attend a banquet and ball given by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
semi-political club at one of the hotels. The
affair was attended by many highly respectable
ladies, particularly by those whose husbands had
any political aspirations, but it was not sufficiently
exclusive to satisfy the Donna, and she
remained at home. The visitors gradually dropped
out until only Mr. Mather remained, and
then Madame Sevier excused herself, on the plea
of fatigue, in order to retire. Instead of going to
her room, however, she hastened to the library
and hid herself behind a statue standing in a
deep bay window, which was heavily shrouded
with drapery and curtains. Thus placed, she
was completely hidden from the sight of any one
in the library, though she had a perfect view
herself, and she could hear every word spoken in
the room.</p>

<p>As she expected, the Donna soon entered, followed
by Mr. Mather. The latter seemed to consider
that the Donna could refuse him nothing,
for he put his arms around her, and was about to
kiss her, when he found her fan quickly interposed
between their faces.</p>

<p>"You are too free with your caresses, Señor
Mather," she said, coldly, slipping out of his embrace,
and pointing out a chair to him at some
distance from the sofa, upon which she seated
herself.</p>

<p>Poor Mather was quite astonished, for, having
kissed her several times before, he supposed that
he could continue doing so whenever he wished;
but the Donna was an expert fisher of men, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
she recognized the force of that old proverb,
"Familiarity breeds contempt;" besides, she
wanted some more money, and she knew that
her elderly lover would gladly purchase her kisses
at a round price. The folly of giving them away
gratis could not be indulged in, therefore, and
she kept her sighing swain at a distance for a
little time. She was too politic to give even the
slightest hint of her object in the conversation
which ensued, but she used every possible allurement
to fascinate her victim, while she would
allow him no liberties nor caresses. Mather
could not fail to recollect the affectionate manner
in which she had received his previous gifts, and
he therefore decided to try the same policy again.</p>

<p>"I saw a beautiful camel's hair shawl to-day,"
he said, "and I was going to get it for you, my
dear Lucia, but I did not know whether it would
suit you, and so I determined to let you select
your own gift. The shawl was worth one thousand
dollars, and I made up my mind to give you
the amount that I should have paid for it, and
you could then exercise your own taste."</p>

<p>"Oh! my dear Henry," she exclaimed, "how
thoughtful you are! How can I sufficiently
thank you?" and she made room for him on the
sofa, as he advanced holding out a roll of bills.</p>

<p>"You know how you can please me best," he
answered, tenderly, bending over her.</p>

<p>"Oh! really, Henry, you mustn't," she protested,
feebly, as he showered kisses on her cheeks
and lips; "suppose any one should come in!"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>As she spoke, a carriage stopped in front of the
house, and their affectionate <i>tête-à-tête</i> was interrupted
by the unexpected return of Lesparre,
who, having left his watch at home, had returned
to get it. He did not enter the parlor nor the
library, but the Donna seemed very much agitated
at the mere possibility of being detected in
a compromising situation, and so Mather took
his departure. The coolness with which she
counted the money, after he had gone, was in
striking contrast with her simulated embarrassment
while he was present, and it was plain
that, having obtained the gift, she was quite glad
to get rid of the giver. She went immediately
to her room, and Madame Sevier then retired
also.</p>




<p class="center">CHAPTER VIII.
</p>

Queen open."&mdash;A Gambler that could not be Bought.&mdash;Splendid

<p>At eleven o'clock, Newton and Bernardi again
met at the post-office, and the latter remarked
that he intended making a short call
upon his wealthy friend.</p>

<p>"Come along with me," he said, "and you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
see what a fine place he has. I shall not remain
very long, and if you will wait for me outside,
we can pass the day together. I hate to go
around alone in a strange city."</p>

<p>Accordingly they strolled along until they
reached Don Pedro's house, and Newton agreed
to remain near at hand until Bernardi should
finish his call. Salter was on the lookout, and
when Bernardi was admitted, he led the way to
Don Pedro's room. The moment the door closed
on Bernardi, Salter took his place at the auger-holes
in the adjoining closet, and overheard the
entire conversation, as before.</p>

<p>"Well, Pietro, have you decided how soon you
will be ready to leave town?" asked the Don.
"From your clothes, jewelry, and other purchases
you have made, you must have used up
most of the money I gave you, and, if so, your
departure must take place soon; for I warn you
again, I shall give you nothing more until you
depart for some distant city!"</p>

<p>"Well, to tell the truth," replied Bernardi, in
an independent, indifferent manner, "I am in no
hurry to go away just yet. You see, I have
been very lucky since I've been here, and if I
keep on, I guess I can repay you the amount
you kindly loaned me."</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you have been gambling
again?" asked the Don, in a vexed tone.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I have won constantly, so that I
don't like to change my luck by making a move
right away. You know gamblers are superst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>itious,
and I have a strong feeling that it will be
for my interest to remain here for some time
yet."</p>

<p>"But you promised to go as soon as you felt
able to travel," said the Don.</p>

<p>"Well, there is no hurry. I haven't done you
any harm yet, and I don't mean to. Why are
you so anxious to get rid of me?"</p>

<p>Of course, Don Pedro's principal fear was that
Bernardi would learn how large a sum the former
had received for his bogus mines, and that he
would not be satisfied to go unless he got a large
slice of the plunder. It would not do, however,
to excite his suspicions by appearing too desirous
of sending him away, so the Don changed his
tone, and said:</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm sure I don't want to get rid of you
as long as you keep sober and don't talk about
me; but you know how it is, Pietro; if you should
get drunk and talk about me, you would tell
everything you know, and the result would be
that I should have to flee the town without accomplishing
my object. In that case, I should
lose not only all that I hoped to make, but also
all the immense outlay I have made in preparing
my scheme. If you want to go to New Orleans
again, I will start you in a faro-bank there, and
will come down there next winter to play with
you; but I confess I should feel easier if you were
out of Gloster for the present."</p>

<p>"Well, I will be ready to go in a few days, if
you insist upon it, but I don't see the necessity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
of such haste. However, I will come in again
and talk about it before the end of the week. I
want to win a little more before I go."</p>

<p>"How have you been betting?" asked Morito,
in a conciliatory manner.</p>

<p>"I have been 'coppering' the jack and playing
the ace and queen 'open,'<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> and I have won
constantly. I left them a few times and played
other cards, but I always lost when I did so.
Now I am going to stick to that scheme right
along."</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> These are technical terms in playing faro. The player
meant that he was in the habit of making one bet that the
jack would be a losing card all the time, and another that
the ace and queen would be winning cards.</p></div>

<p>"Where are you playing?" asked the Don,
carelessly.</p>

<p>"I generally go to Dave Carter's, in Mahogany
Block, for I think he deals a 'square' game."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so," said Morito; "as much so
as any of them; but they are all sharpers here,
and they may have been letting you win on purpose,
thinking that you had a large sum in reserve
which they hope to catch hereafter. If
you will take my advice, you will stop while you
are ahead. You know, from your own experience
as a banker, that the 'bank' always wins
in the end."</p>

<p>"Well, I shall try a few more games, and then
I shall be ready to talk with you about going
South. I want to run my luck while it is good,"
and so saying, Bernardi rose to go.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>
<p>"All right, Pietro," said Don Pedro, "be careful
not to get swindled, and to keep silent about
me."</p>

<p>The moment Bernardi was gone, the Don rang
his bell violently, and sent for Monsieur Lesparre.
When the latter entered the Don's room, he
found his employer in a more disturbed and excited
condition than he had ever before indulged
in, and evidently he meant mischief to some
one.</p>

<p>"Lesparre, that fellow Bernardi, of whom I
spoke to you the other day, has been here
again," burst out the Don. "I gave him a considerable
sum of money to set him on his feet
again, for old acquaintance' sake, expecting that
he would return to his friends in the South, or,
at least, behave like a decent gentleman; but he
has returned to his old habits of gambling and
drinking, so that, at any moment, he may come
here and mortify me before a party of my
guests, or, worse still, claim me as his friend
when arraigned in a police court for drunkenness,
<i>etcetera</i>. He promised to leave town as
soon as the money I gave him was gone, and I
was to give him then a respectable sum to start
him in business elsewhere; but he has won considerably
at the faro-table, and he is now independent
of me, and therefore declines to keep his
promise until he is ready."</p>

<p>"Would he go, do you think, if he should lose
all he has?" asked Lesparre.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes, indeed; he would be forced to yield<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
to my terms then, and I should give him nothing
until he started."</p>

<p>"How would it do to suggest to the proprietor
of the gambling rooms that it would be doubly
for his interest to fleece this man? I think it
could easily be done, if the 'bank' were so disposed."</p>

<p>"I have no doubt of it, especially as I know
the way he intends to bet all the time," replied
the Don, eagerly; "he 'coppers' the jack and plays
the ace and queen 'open.' It must be a pretty
poor dealer who cannot 'stack' those cards, with
such a stake in view. Suppose you drop a hint
to Dave Carter, or to the dealer to-night, before
Bernardi goes there."</p>

<p>"I will go down at once," replied Lesparre,
"and I will promise him three hundred dollars
additional if he wins all that Bernardi has; that
is not too much, is it?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed!" exclaimed the Don; "I would
gladly give five hundred, if necessary."</p>

<p>Lesparre arrived at the gambling rooms about
noon, and at that early hour no one was present
except the proprietor and one of the dealers.
Lesparre obtained an interview with the proprietor
alone, and then asked him if he would like to
make a thousand dollars.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," he replied, in an indifferent way,
"I should have no objection, although it would
not be such a novelty that I need take a great
deal of trouble about it. The 'bank' often wins
more than that in a single evening."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, there is a South American who has
been playing here recently, against whom I have
a bitter grudge. He has about six hundred dollars
now, most of which he has won here. He
has one regular system of playing&mdash;'coppering'
the jack and playing the ace and queen to win&mdash;and
you can easily fix those cards so as to clean
him out in one evening. The moment you have
done that, I will give you five hundred dollars
more."</p>

<p>The gambler fixed a keen look upon Lesparre
for a moment, and then replied that he was no
gudgeon to bite such a stale bait as that. He
added that they played a "square" game, and if a
man won, he was welcome to his winnings; but
that no trickery would be resorted to against any
patron of the house. Lesparre was obliged to
withdraw, feeling that he had made a mistake in
proposing the plan so openly.</p>

<p>That evening, after a day spent in playing billiards
and driving about, Bernardi and Newton
again entered the gambling saloon. Bernardi did
not make any bets for some time, but stood
watching the game in silence, apparently guessing
as to the winning and losing cards to determine
whether he was in luck. Finally he bet
fifty dollars on the ace and lost; this was followed
by one hundred dollars on the same card, which
again lost. He waited a few deals and then placed
two hundred dollars on the queen to win, and one
hundred dollars on the jack to lose. The cards
fell as he had hoped, and gathering in his stakes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a><br /><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>and winnings, he began betting in earnest. His
luck was wonderful, and as all his bets were for
fifty dollars or more, he soon had quite a large
sum. Presently he stopped betting, and went to
the bar with Newton. They talked and drank
together for some minutes, but Bernardi was not
ready to leave just then. His winnings were already
quite sufficient to cause the proprietor to
regard him with a considerable degree of interest,
and when he returned to the faro-table, a seat
was given him at once. He made no bets for
some minutes, but at length he asked:</p>

<p>[Illustration: <i>This was taking a short cut to Bernardi's friendship.</i>]</p>

<p>"What is your limit to-night?"</p>

<p>"Five hundred dollars," was the reply.</p>

<p>Bernardi then placed four hundred dollars on
the nine spot, and, a moment later, he was again
a winner. He now seemed satisfied, for he presented
his "chips" for payment, and received
cash therefor. The proprietor then invited Bernardi
and Newton to drink with him, and, while
standing at the sideboard, the proprietor asked
Bernardi whether he had many acquaintances in
the city.</p>

<p>"No," replied Bernardi, "I have very few;
why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Because one of them is your enemy, or else
he was trying to play a trick on the 'bank' this
morning," continued the proprietor, watching
Bernardi narrowly. "He came in about noon,
and wanted the cards put up so that you should
be cleaned out of all your money."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>"The devil you say!" ejaculated Bernardi;
"why did he want to clean me out?"</p>

<p>"That I can't say; but he told me that he had
a bitter grudge against you, and that he would
give a great deal to injure you."</p>

<p>"I do not know any one here who could say
that of me," replied Bernardi, thoughtfully.
"There is only one man in the city who knows
me intimately, and I do not see why he should
wish me to lose, even if he did hate me. Was he
a South American, like myself?"</p>

<p>"No; he might have been a foreigner, but he
was not dark-complexioned."</p>

<p>"Well, I cannot imagine who it could have
been," mused Bernardi; "and I guess I need not
be afraid of him, if he goes to work in that roundabout
way. However, I am obliged to you for
the information, and I will take care that he does
not drop on me unexpectedly. So-long."</p>

<p>As Bernardi walked down the street with Newton,
he was evidently deeply abstracted, for he
muttered to himself in Spanish, and swore at intervals
in quite an excited manner. Finally, he
said aloud:</p>

<p>"I don't know what to think about this story.
It may be that this gambler made it up to shake
my nerves, or to cover some plot against me; but
I have a sort of feeling that Don Juan is at the
bottom of it. I don't fear him one bit, but I want
to solve the mystery, and if he has been plotting
against me, I will have my revenge upon him.
But, no; I can't see what he could gain by it, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
I think, perhaps, this gang despair of breaking
my luck, and are planning to rob me by force."</p>

<p>"That seems reasonable," replied Newton, "for
then you would attribute the act to this unknown
enemy, and they would escape suspicion. Still,"
he continued, anxious to lead the conversation
back to Don Pedro as a subject, "your first supposition
may be the correct one, and your pretended
friend may be scheming to ruin you."</p>

<p>"But why should he want me to lose money?"
persisted Bernardi. "He knows that I should
come to him for more, and that he would be
obliged to give it to me."</p>

<p>"Perhaps he would like to get rid of your presence,"
cautiously suggested Newton; "and if you
were penniless, he could insist upon your departure
as a condition upon which alone he would
give you money."</p>

<p>"Caramba! I believe you are right, my friend,"
Bernardi exclaimed, furiously; "and if I find that
it is so, I will make Don Juan, or Don Pedro, as
he calls himself now, regret the day he played me
false."</p>

<p>"Don't be over-hasty," counseled Newton, "for
the whole story may be a gambler's lie after all."</p>

<p>"Oh! I will investigate it carefully," answered
Bernardi, "and, when I am satisfied
about the truth of the matter, I will consult with
you as to the best course to pursue. It is a good
thing to have a friend to advise with, especially
among such a gang of thieves as seem to hang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
'round these rooms. Meet me to-morrow, as
usual, and I will go see my friend again."</p>

<p>The men then separated, and went to their respective
lodgings for the night.</p>

<p>In the morning they met, took breakfast
together, and afterwards sauntered down to visit
Don Pedro. As before, Bernardi was conducted
straight to the Don's room, and Salter again stationed
himself in the closet to listen.</p>

<p>"So you are still successful?" was the first remark
he heard.</p>

<p>"Yes, moderately so," replied Bernardi; "but
it is strange how cards run sometimes."</p>

<p>"Well, you ought not to be astonished at anything
after your long experience in gambling."</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm never astonished," said Bernardi,
who had drunk a good deal of brandy before and
after breakfast; "but I was thinking how lucky
it was that I changed my mind last night about
playing those three cards&mdash;the jack, ace, and
queen."</p>

<p>"How so?" asked Morito.</p>

<p>"Well, if I had played the jack 'coppered,'
and the ace and queen 'open,' last night, all the
evening, I should have been entirely cleaned out;
what do you think of that?"</p>

<p>"I think you were very lucky in having played
elsewhere," replied the Don; "but what's the
matter with you? What makes you look at me
so strangely?"</p>

<p>"I want to find out whether it was you who
sent a man to tell Dave Carter, the gambler, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
I was playing, and to ask him to fix the cards so
that I should lose all I had."</p>

<p>Bernardi's voice was husky with liquor and
anger, and he had evidently worked himself up
into a great rage; but, in spite of his partial intoxication,
he was very determined, and his tones
foreboded no good-will to the Don. In a contest
of words, however, he was no match for his opponent,
and Don Pedro instantly took the most
effectual method for quieting his visitor's suspicions.</p>

<p>"My dear Pietro," he began, contemptuously,
"I gave you credit for more common-sense than
you seem disposed to claim for yourself. Why
should I want you to lose? On the contrary, I
would like to see you win enough to start in
business for yourself, and repay me what I have
loaned you, for I assure you that I much prefer
to have you spend your money than mine. I
have none too much for my own wants, and if
you could repay me, I should be delighted. What
is the reason for your question?"</p>

<p>Bernardi did not reply for two or three
minutes; he was evidently keenly scrutinizing
Don Pedro's face; but at length he said:</p>

<p>"Well, it's all right now, and I suppose I was
wrong to suspect you; but the proprietor of the
place where I gamble told me that some one had
been trying to get him to play a trick on me,
and I determined to find out who it was."</p>

<p>"Well, Pietro, I don't think you would have
thought of suspecting me if your head had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
been fuddled with liquor. Why can't you stop
drinking for a month or two?"</p>

<p>"What do you care about my drinking?"
asked Bernardi, in a half-cowed manner.</p>

<p>"Because Pietro drunk is a very different fellow
from Pietro sober; and some day you will
let out some damaging reports about me, and
then all hope of making anything here will be
destroyed. If I could feel sure that you would
remain sober, I would gladly start you in a good
'bank' here."</p>

<p>Of course, Don Pedro had no intention of doing
anything of the kind, but he saw that Bernardi
was in a dangerous mood, and that he must
handle him very skillfully if he wished to get
him to leave the city. The Don knew that to
urge him to leave would be the surest way to
make him stay, but that, if left to follow his
own inclinations, he would be anxious to go
South, where the climate and people were more
congenial to him. Hence, Don Pedro boldly
took the ground that he was quite willing for
Bernardi to stay if he would only keep sober,
and Bernardi quickly fell into the trap.</p>

<p>"I don't want to start a 'bank' in this place,"
he said, "and I can't get along in this climate
without drinking. I have been moderately successful
here, and I am in no hurry to leave, but I
should like to go back to New Orleans, if I could
fit up a good place there, and deal a first-class
game."</p>

<p>"How much would you need for that pur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>pose?"
asked the Don. "If I can let you have it,
I will do so, and you can stay here or go back to
New Orleans, as you may prefer; only I shall
make one condition: that you promise faithfully
to drink nothing but wine while you are in this
city, until I get ready to leave. Will three thousand
dollars be enough?"</p>

<p>"Hardly; I have won some money here, to be
sure, but it will cost a good deal to spread a handsome
layout in New Orleans&mdash;as for this place,
there are not enough gentlemen gamesters here;
the gamblers are all trying to live on each other.
If you will make it five thousand, I will start for
New Orleans day after to-morrow."</p>

<p>"That is more than I ought to pay out in my
present circumstances," said the Don, thoughtfully;
"but I guess I can run the establishment
on credit for about a month, and that will help
me out; so if you will go to-morrow, I will give
you five thousand when you start."</p>

<p>"Done!" replied Bernardi, much gratified at
having obtained so large a sum. "I have nothing
to do except to get a young lady friend to
go with me, and she won't need a great while to
make her preparations. So you can have the
money ready to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"It shall be awaiting you any time that you
call for it," answered Morito, and Bernardi then
took his departure.</p>

<p>On joining Newton, Bernardi was in high
spirits, and he talked very freely of his intended
plans.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>"My friend convinced me that he had nothing
to do with the trick which the gambler said some
one tried to play upon me, and as a proof of his
regard, he is going to give me a start in New Orleans.
I shall leave here to-morrow, and if you
would like to go in with me, we can make a pile
of money there."</p>

<p>"I can't very well leave here for some time
yet," said Newton, "for I have a large sum
staked in bets on the races next month, and I
shall have no money until they take place. I
have a sure thing on a new horse, and I have got
such large odds that I have put up every dollar I
could reach. I shall clear about ten thousand
dollars sure, and then if you are so disposed, I
will join you in New Orleans."</p>

<p>"All right, we'll do it; but then, you may lose
everything instead of winning. I don't care to
bet on races, myself; there are too many chances
to deal from the bottom."</p>

<p>"There is no danger in this case, so you must
let me know where I can find you, and within a
month I will join you in the Crescent City."</p>

<p>Bernardi then went to see his fair and frail
charmer, to obtain her company on his Southern
trip, and Newton came to my room to report. I
instructed him to stay with Bernardi as much as
possible while the latter remained in the city,
and to be sure to obtain his address in New Orleans.
I then called upon Senator Muirhead and
informed him of the proposed departure of Bernardi.
The Senator was very anxious to detain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
him in some way, in order to get his testimony,
in case we should fail to hear from England or
Peru in time; but I was unable to suggest any
plan for holding this man without exposing our
whole connection with the case. Bernardi was
evidently ready to act in good faith with Don
Pedro, and any endeavor to retard his departure
would be regarded by him as coming from the
gang of gamblers from whom he had won money.
There was no doubt but that he would keep up a
correspondence with Newton, and we should thus
know where to find him in case his presence
should be needed. We decided, therefore, to let
him go as he intended.</p>

<p>Early in the evening, Bernardi and Newton
went as usual to the gaming-rooms. There they
met a stranger, who seemed to be a Spaniard or
Cuban. Bernardi addressed him in Spanish, and
after some conversation, they sat down to play.
By some freak of luck, Bernardi continually won
his small bets, but whenever he put out a large
amount, he lost. The Cuban stranger had the
same experience, and at length Bernardi rose in
disgust and left the rooms with Newton, having
lost about two hundred dollars.</p>

<p>"Those fellows have got some kind of a 'skin-game'
at work," he said, "and they tried to beat
me and that Cuban out of all our cash. I gave
him a hint in Spanish before I came away, and I
hope he will stop before they fleece him. Now
let us go to the theatre."</p>

<p>They attended one of the theatres, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
had a glorious supper at Bernardi's expense after
the performance was over. About midnight,
they parted with mutual good wishes, and Bernardi
promised to write to Newton as soon as he
should reach New Orleans.</p>

<p>The next morning Bernardi called upon Don
Pedro and received the promised amount of five
thousand dollars, assuring him that he should
leave the city that afternoon. As soon as he left
the house, the Don asked Lesparre to keep a
watch upon Bernardi to make sure of his leaving
according to promise. When Lesparre returned
about three o'clock, and reported that Bernardi
was then actually on his way to Cairo, accompanied
by a young lady, the Don was overjoyed,
and he expressed himself greatly relieved thereby.</p>

<p>"Now we can take more interest in our <i>fête
champêtre</i>, and we will make it the most delightful
affair ever known in this country," he said,
exultantly. "When it is over, my dear Lesparre,
we will make a tour of the fashionable
watering-places, and enjoy life to the full."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>




<p class="center">CHAPTER IX.
</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Important Information from the Peruvian Government.&mdash;Arrival
in Gloster of the Peruvian Minister
and Consul.&mdash;In Consultation.&mdash;"Robbing Peter
to pay Paul."&mdash;Mr. Pinkerton's card is presented.&mdash;Juan

Pinkerton not "For Sale."&mdash;A Dramatic
Scene.&mdash;The Bubble burst.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>Several days now sped by with no fresh developments,
and Don Pedro was almost constantly
engaged in his preparations for the <i>fête
champêtre</i>. As the day approached, society was
stirred to its very center, and nothing was spoken
of save this grand event of the season.</p>

<p>But four days remained before the <i>fête</i>, when I
was delighted by receiving a letter from the Secretary
of State for Peru, giving full particulars
of the forgeries and frauds committed by Don
Juan Sanchez in that country, and enclosing a
fine portrait of the man. One glance at the picture
was sufficient to assure me of the identity
of Don Pedro P. L. de Morito with Don Juan
Sanchez, and I now felt ready to act. The letter
informed me that a Peruvian official would be
dispatched to Gloster at once, to obtain the arrest
of Don Pedro, though there were a great many
difficulties in the way, owing to the lack of an
extradition treaty. Every effort would be made,
however, to bring him to justice, and the Peru<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>vian
Minister at Washington would be instructed
to confer with me.</p>

<p>I informed Senator Muirhead and Judge Key
of this news, and they were both much encouraged
at the prospect, especially as we learned
that a Peruvian man-of-war had arrived in New
York from Aspinwall, it being doubtless intended
that this vessel should take the prisoner to Peru,
in case he could be frightened into surrendering
himself.</p>

<p>The <i>fête</i> was to take place on Wednesday, if
the weather should be favorable, or on the first
pleasant day thereafter, and everything was already
in complete order for the grand occasion.
A large and elegant steamer had been chartered
to convey the guests to the island, and she was to
make several trips during the day for the convenience
of business men who could not go early.
There remained nothing further to be done, except
to pray for fine weather on the important
day.</p>

<p>On Monday morning I was told that two gentlemen
were waiting to see me, on very important
business, at one of the leading hotels. I accompanied
the messenger, and was at once shown
to the room of the Peruvian Minister, who was
accompanied by the Peruvian Consul at New
York. Before proceeding to business, I informed
the Minister that I was acting under the instructions
of Senator Muirhead, and that I should like
to send for that gentleman, and for my legal adviser,
Judge Key. The Peruvian officials made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
no objection, and both Judge Key and the Senator
were soon with us, ready for consultation.
As the new arrivals were tired and dusty after
their long journey, we merely exchanged information
relative to Don Pedro, and agreed to meet
at ten o'clock next morning, to make plans for
his arrest.</p>

<p>At the appointed hour, we were all prompt in
arriving at the parlor of the Minister. The latter
and the Consul, in accordance with a suggestion
I had made the day previous, had not mentioned
their official rank to any one, and had remained
as secluded as possible, in order to prevent Morito
from knowing of their arrival in the city.</p>

<p>The Minister stated that the forgeries of Don
Juan Sanchez in Peru had been so enormous,
amounting to more than seven hundred thousand
dollars, that the government had taken up the
pursuit of the criminal with unusual zeal, and no
effort nor expense would be spared to bring him
to justice. Unfortunately, however, in the absence
of any extradition treaty between Peru
and the United States, the chances of securing
Don Juan, even now that he had been discovered,
were not bright; indeed, the Minister acknowledged
that he saw no way of accomplishing
it.</p>

<p>"By an appeal to law," said Judge Key, "nothing
<i>can</i> be gained; but it is possible that my
friend, Mr. Pinkerton, may have a plan which
will induce Don Pedro, as he now calls himself,
to surrender voluntarily rather than stand trial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
here or in Great Britain. Let us hear your opinion,
then, Mr. Pinkerton."</p>

<p>"Well, gentlemen," I replied, "this is a case
where the greatest care must be exercised, for the
criminal is a bold, skillful man, of good education
and address, with, probably, a fair knowledge
of his legal rights. We cannot afford to
make any mistakes, for he would surely take advantage
of them. We must, therefore, present
the case to him in such a way that he will believe
it to be to his interest to give himself up.
The presence of the Peruvian man-of-war in New
York is very fortunate, for, once under her flag,
he cannot escape; but he must be induced to go
on board voluntarily, or else we shall be liable to
the charge of kidnapping."</p>

<p>I then explained the method by which he had
had swindled the citizens of Gloster, and showed
how difficult it would be to convict him of anything,
owing to the probability that his victims
would refuse to testify against him; besides, for
obtaining money under false pretenses, a short
imprisonment only could be inflicted, and then he
would be free to go where he pleased.</p>

<p>"However," I continued, "I think I can present
to him his position in such a light that he
will regard a surrender to the Peruvian authorities
as preferable to a long trial and detention
here, with the possibility of being sent to California
or Great Britain for trial on a more serious
charge. When he knows that we are fully ac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>quainted
with his past career, he may be willing
to accept our terms rather than to defy us."</p>

<p>"Suppose, however," said the Minister, "that
he should refuse all terms, and determine to fight
it out?"</p>

<p>"In that case," I replied, "we should be obliged
to arrest him here for obtaining money under
false pretenses, and be prepared to arrest him
again the moment he should be set free, repeating
the operation as often as we could get different
victims to enter complaint against him. The
number of stockholders in this bogus company is
quite large, so that we could easily hold him until
a requisition could be obtained from California
or England."</p>

<p>"How large a sum has he in his possession
now?" asked the Consul.</p>

<p>"About half a million dollars," replied the
Senator.</p>

<p>"Well," said the Consul, "that sum will go
far toward reimbursing the people whom he
swindled in Peru, so I think that Mr. Pinkerton's
plan is the best that can be adopted. We
might induce him to go aboard our vessel by
promising to use our influence to lighten his sentence,
in case he makes restitution to his victims
in Peru."</p>

<p>The Consul made these remarks with a wise
expression, as if he thought he had hit upon a
very easy way of solving the problem. The Senator,
Judge Key, and I exchanged looks of astonishment
and amusement at this cool proposal to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
take our citizens' money to reimburse the Peruvians;
it was a case of "robbing Peter to pay
Paul" which we could not appreciate. Finally,
I said:</p>

<p>"I presume that there can be no question as
to the way to dispose of this money which Don
Pedro has in his possession. Not one penny of
it came from Peru, and we cannot permit any of
it to be taken there. On arriving here Don Pedro
had only a few thousand dollars, which he obtained
in England by forgery. This sum he has
already used up, and the only money in his possession
has been obtained by the sale of his fictitious
diamond fields in Peru. It would be manifestly
unjust to allow this money to be taken
away, and it is our intention to obtain it at all
hazards, whatever may become of the Don."</p>

<p>"Oh! I shall make no such claim, Mr. Pinkerton,"
said the Minister; "that was only a suggestion
of the Consul, who did not understand
exactly how the money referred to came into this
man's hands. All that I care for is to get Don
Pedro on board our vessel, and I shall be pleased
to pay for your services in the matter. We must
be careful, however, that there shall be no opportunity
to charge us with kidnapping, for we
wish to avoid any possibility of complications
with the United States; the fellow has made us
trouble enough already."</p>

<p>"I will arrange that matter satisfactorily," I
replied; "as for the question of payment, I am
acting wholly in the interest of Senator Muirhead,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
and under his instructions, so that I can accept
nothing except from him."</p>

<p>We spent an hour or two more in preparing
papers and arranging the details of our plans, the
conclusion being that we should make the arrest
that evening, about seven o'clock, when there
would be few or no visitors at Don Pedro's house.
As I had supposed, there was no charge whatever
against the Donna, and my only intentions with
regard to her were to see that she did not carry
off any of the money belonging to the Diamond
Company stockholders, nor assist the Don to
escape. It was decided to send Don Pedro to
New York immediately, in case he yielded to our
terms, and the Donna would be at liberty to go
or stay, as she might see fit.</p>

<p>On returning to my office, I found Bangs and
Lesparre awaiting me, and the latter said that he
believed the Don and Donna intended to take
flight immediately after the <i>fête</i>. They probably
desired to finish their career in Gloster in a blaze
of glory, and, as they would not be expected to
receive visitors for two or three days after the
<i>fête</i>, they would have a good start before their
departure would become known. I told Lesparre
to see that Madame Sevier and Salter kept a close
watch for the remainder of the day, and in case
any attempt should be made to remove the box
containing Don Pedro's coin, he must send Salter
to me instantly with the news. I also suggested
that the servants be kept out of the way that
evening, so that no one should know of our visit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
Lesparre departed to attend to his duties, and I
remained to complete the details of my plans
with Mr. Bangs, who had arrived from Chicago
with two detectives, in obedience to my summons.</p>

<p>About six o'clock, Senator Muirhead and Judge
Key arrived, and a more nervous man than the
former I never saw. In a few minutes the Peruvian
Minister and Consul arrived, and we proceeded
in carriages to Don Pedro's house, the
Senator remaining at the hotel, however. We
left the carriages a short distance away, so as not
to attract attention, and, while Mr. Bangs's two
men stationed themselves to watch the house, the
rest of my party ascended the steps and were
admitted by Salter.</p>

<p>"The family are still at dinner," said Salter,
"but they are finishing the dessert, and I presume
Don Pedro will go to the billiard-room after
dinner to smoke, as usual."</p>

<p>"Give him my card as he leaves the dining-room,"
I said, "and tell him that I am waiting
to see him in the drawing-room."</p>

<p>In a few minutes, Don Pedro and Lesparre rose
from the table, and Salter gave my card to the
former.</p>

<p>"Pinkerton! Pinkerton! I don't know any one
of that name; do I, Lesparre?"</p>

<p>"Possibly it may be some gentleman having
business with you in connection with the <i>fête</i>,"
suggested Lesparre.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah! very true; where is he, George? I will
see him at once," said the Don, unsuspectingly.</p>

<p>Salter led the way to the drawing-room, where
I alone was waiting, the rest of the party having
waited in the vestibule. As he entered, followed
by Lesparre, I rose and said:</p>

<p>"Juan Sanchez, I arrest you, and you are now
my prisoner!" and, so saying, I put my hand on
his shoulder.</p>

<p>He turned very pale, and sat down in the nearest
chair, while Lesparre quickly brought him a
glass of water. I then continued:</p>

<p>"Juan Sanchez, or José Gomez more properly,
we will retire to the library if you wish, as we
may be interrupted here by the arrival, of some of
your friends, and I do not wish to expose you at
present."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by addressing me in this
manner?" he replied, trying to regain his composure.
"My name is neither Sanchez nor Gomez."</p>

<p>"It is a long time since you have been so
called," I answered, "but your victims in Brazil
and Peru still retain the names in their memories
without difficulty. I will now present to you the
Minister of Peru and the Peruvian Consul at New
York, both of whom have taken a lively interest
in your past life and actions."</p>

<p>Just as I spoke, the Donna and Madame Sevier
entered, and the former, seeing the abject appearance
of her husband, asked what was the matter.</p>

<p>"Your husband is a prisoner, madam," I re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>plied;
"and as our interview would be painful to
you, I must ask you to withdraw for the present
at least."</p>

<p>She immediately gave an hysterical scream,
and sank upon a divan sobbing frantically.
Madame Sevier succeeded in quieting her somewhat,
and she remained on the scene with her
face buried in the Madame's lap. I felt confident
that much of her emotion was feigned, and that
she was an attentive listener to all that took place
about her; however, I made no objection, but requested
Mr. Bangs, who was watching in the hall,
to admit the Minister and the rest of the party.
As Mr. Bangs withdrew, the Don stepped up to
me and said:</p>

<p>"Mr. Pinkerton, I will give you five thousand
dollars if you will leave me alone for half an
hour."</p>

<p>I smiled, and looking at my watch, said:</p>

<p>"It is now seven o'clock; at ten o'clock you
will be on your way to New York."</p>

<p>"You can have ten thousand, if you will let
me go; I will pay you the cash in coin immediately."</p>

<p>"Your offers are useless," I replied; "I will
let no guilty man escape if it can be avoided."</p>

<p>As I spoke, the Peruvian Minister, the Consul,
and Judge Key entered, and we proceeded in a
body to the library, leaving the Donna in the care
of Madame Sevier. On the way thither, the Don
made one more effort to appear in the <i>rôle</i> of an
injured innocent.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't understand this proceeding at all," he
said, "and I claim my liberty. What authority
have you for arresting me in my own house?"</p>

<p>"I <i>have</i> the authority, and that is sufficient,"
I replied, coolly. "If you desire to be taken at
once to jail, I have no objection to granting your
request; but I thought, perhaps, you might first
prefer to hear what these gentlemen have to say."</p>

<p>I have arrested and have watched a great
many criminals, but I have never seen one who,
having carried out such an extensive scheme of
villainy, was so utterly broken down as this man
was. I had feared that his nerve might be firm
enough to answer my threats with defiance, and
force me to bring him to trial in Gloster; but I
saw that there was no danger of such a misfortune,
and so I stood aside while the Peruvian
Minister addressed him.</p>

<p>"Juan Sanchez," said the Minister, "I have
come here to obtain your removal to Peru, that
you may be tried there for your numberless
forgeries in that country. A Peruvian war-ship is
now in New York harbor, and you will be placed
on board of her for transportation to Peru. Mr.
Pinkerton's superintendent will proceed with you
to-night."</p>

<p>The Don was speechless for a moment, and
then, glancing up, he said, in a sullen voice:</p>

<p>"I want to know what I am charged with,
and by what right you send me to Peru. I am
entitled to a hearing, and a lawyer to defend
me."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>"My friend, Judge Key, who is present, is a
most able lawyer," I replied, "and you can consult
with him if you wish advice; but first let
me show you your true position. Your real
name, Don José Gomez, was given you in Brazil,
where it is remembered only to be cursed; Don
Juan Sanchez was your name in Peru, and your
crimes there are also well known; as Don José
Michel, there are serious charges against you in
San Francisco; Don Pedro Michel is badly wanted
in Quito, where he would probably be shot, as
they treat criminals there rather unceremoniously;
and Don José Arias would undoubtedly be
transported for life if the London detectives
should discover his present hiding place, to say
nothing of a lively interest which the French
<i>gens d'armes</i> take in the same person. All of
these people are now informed that the person
whom they wish to find is living in Gloster as
Don Pedro P. L. de Morito, and they are at this
moment hastening agents here to arrest him.
By chance, the Peruvian authorities are the first
to arrive, and they have, therefore, the happy
privilege of making the arrest. Now, as you are
probably aware, the Minister will have some
difficulty in obtaining an order from Washington
authorizing me to send you to Peru, for want of
an extradition treaty; but while you are under
arrest here, we can easily get warrants from
either California, England, or France, and then
you can take your choice between being shot by
vigilantes in California, transported to Van<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
Dieman's Land by England, or sent to work in the
galleys by France. This is your present situation,
and I am perfectly indifferent which course
you prefer. If you decide to go with the Peruvian
Minister, you must agree to do so voluntarily,
until you are placed on board the Peruvian vessel,
and you must make an assignment of all your
money and property here to reimburse the people
whom you have swindled by the sale of fictitious
diamond-fields. If you are willing to comply
with these conditions, you will sign all the necessary
papers at once, and you will leave for New
York to-night, before the English extradition
writ arrives; if you refuse these conditions, I
shall hold you until that writ, or one from California,
arrives."</p>

<p>The Don was evidently in no mood for defiance:
the knowledge of his past history which I displayed
had wholly cowed him, and my allusions
to the vigilantes of California, and the galleys of
France, made him tremble like a leaf. He knew
perfectly well the extent of his crimes in those
places, and, also, that my hints of his probable
punishment were not fancy sketches. Finally,
he asked to see me alone, but I refused to grant
his request, knowing his object. Then he wished
to see the Minister alone, and I again objected,
but I accompanied the two to another room,
where they conversed in Spanish for some time.
The Minister told me that the Don offered the
whole of his money and property to allow him to
escape; but, finding his offers useless, he agreed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
go to Peru for trial. No pledges were made to him
to influence his decision, though he begged so hard
that the Minister would intercede for him with
the authorities in Peru, that his Excellency
finally promised, in view of the Don's consent to
go willingly, to recommend that his punishment
be the lightest that the law could allow. The
Don having fully yielded to the arguments of the
Minister and myself, nothing remained to be
done except to obtain his signature to the papers
which had been already prepared, and to pack
his trunk for his journey. Lesparre and Salter
performed the latter task while the Don was
signing the papers, and writing out his voluntary
agreement to deliver himself up to the Peruvian
authorities. The most important document was
a deed assigning his furniture, horses, carriages,
paintings, statuary, books, and, in short, all his
personal property, to Judge Key, to be disposed
of at the latter's discretion, and the proceeds,
with the large amount of cash on hand, to be applied
to repay the subscribers to the Diamond
Company stock. In case there should not be sufficient
to pay them in full, the payments should
be made <i>pro rata</i>; but should there be an excess,
such excess should be applied to the payment of
the Don's private debts, contracted prior to that
date. This provision was, of course, necessary to
shut out the bills for supplies and services at the
<i>fête</i> on the following day. Evidently it was too
late to interfere with that interesting entertainment
without throwing a heavy loss on many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
persons who could not afford to be the sufferers,
and I saw only one way to prevent this, namely;
to let the <i>fête</i> go on, and make those who danced
pay the piper.</p>

<p>When the documents had all been signed, I
said:</p>

<p>"José Gomez, you fully understand the meaning
of this paper?" holding up his surrender to
the Peruvian authorities; "it gives me power to
convey you to New York and place you on board
of a Peruvian vessel, using force, if necessary."</p>

<p>The Don bowed his head submissively, and said
that he so understood it. The acknowledgment
of the deeds was then made by Judge Key, who
was a notary public, and our success was complete.
The Donna was then informed that her
husband would be taken East that night, and she
professed to be much affected. I told her that
there was no charge against her, and that she
could go with her husband, or stay in Gloster,
according to her own wishes. She said that she
would go with him if Madame Sevier could accompany
them. I had no objection to this, and
the two ladies retired to pack their trunks. There
was some uncertainty in my mind whether some
of the Don's cash might not be in the Donna's
possession; but I felt rather confident that she
kept her money entirely separate from his, and
that I could trust to Madame Sevier's acuteness
to discover how much the Donna had on hand.
I was not disappointed, for, while packing, the
Donna told the Madame that she had about nine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
thousand dollars, the remains of her gifts from
Mather, but that she could secure an immense
sum out of the iron box if she could get it open.
I had already made the Don confess where he
had hidden his money, and one of my detectives
was placed to guard the box; hence, the Donna
was disappointed in her attempts to make a raid
on the treasury. While the packing was going
on, I sent to the railroad dépôt and bought eight
railroad tickets for the party, which was to consist
of the Minister, the Consul, the Don and
Donna, Mr. Bangs, Madame Sevier, and two of
my men. At half-past nine o'clock the party
was ready and the trunks were sent off. I had
kept a close watch upon the Don until now, and
I saw that he hoped to escape while traveling.
When the carriages were announced, I stepped
up to him and told him that my invariable custom
in such cases would require me to put him
in irons to prevent any attempt at escape.</p>

<p>"Shall you permit me to be treated in this
manner?" he said to the Peruvian Minister.</p>

<p>"You are not yet in the custody of the Peruvian
authorities," I replied, "and I am responsible
for your safe delivery in New York; hence I
must take such precautions as I consider necessary.
When you are on board the Peruvian vessel,
the Minister can give such orders concerning
you as he may think proper; but, until then, I
alone have the right to determine what shall be
done with you."</p>

<p>In a moment, I had placed a light set of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
shackles on his feet, and handcuffs on his wrists;
he was quite submissive now, and only seemed
anxious to avoid observation.</p>

<p>As we passed out to the carriages, the Donna
handed me a note, addressed to Henry O. Mather,
and asked me to have it delivered immediately.
I agreed to send it at once, though I sent it in
such a manner that he should not receive it until
the morning after the <i>fête</i>. The party arrived at
the dépôt in time to secure seats together, and at
ten o'clock the train bore them from the city.</p>

<p>To the great delight of hundreds of people in
Gloster, Wednesday morning revealed all
the indications of a pleasant day, and by noon
the weather was so lovely that nothing could
have been more auspicious for the grand occasion.
As the hour approached for the departure
of the steamer, carriage after carriage drew up
at the dock to discharge its load of brilliantly-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>dressed
and masked ladies and gentlemen. The
only person who was not completely protected
from recognition was Monsieur Lesparre, who
stood at the gangway to receive the guests, and
wore a plain evening dress, with no mask.</p>

<p>In order to prevent the attendance of persons
who had not been invited, each guest was required
to present his or her invitation, and, as
there were, as usual, many who had forgotten to
bring their cards, Lesparre remained at hand to
pass them on board, on leaving their names.
When the hour of departure arrived, the boat
swung out into the stream, amid the laughter
and merry shouts of the gay revelers that
crowded her decks, as the band flooded the air
with music.</p>

<p>At first there was some embarrassment and reserve
in the intercourse between the masqueraders,
owing to the novelty of their situation, and
the fact that the ladies at first clung closely to
their own little parties, with whom they had come
and to whom they were known; but soon this
feeling wore off. They began to enter into the
merry spirit of revelry which characterizes such
entertainments in the cities of the Old World.
The idea of personal identity began to be lost in
the gayety of the moment, and in its place was
substituted an identification of each person with
the character which that person represented. The
balmy airs of a perfect spring day wafted to them
the sounds of country life along the shores of the
river, and gave sensations both novel and pleas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a><br /><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a><br /><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>ing
to the gay denizens of the city, who rarely
experienced any change from their routine of
fashionable entertainments. During the trip by
steamer there was much speculation as to the
disguises worn by the Don and Donna, and though
several persons were suspected of being the host
and hostess, there was no sufficient way of identifying
them.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <i>The Fête Champêtre.&mdash;Page&mdash;</i>]</p>

<p>At length the island was reached, and the party
disembarked. The scene, as they took possession
of the tents, booths, and pleasure-grounds, was
brilliant and attractive beyond anything which
the guests had ever witnessed. The island was
covered with large trees, whose branches and
foliage afforded a delightful shade. The close
underbrush had been removed everywhere, except
in certain ravines and other picturesque
spots, so that the island presented a fine example
of the beauties of landscape gardening. The foreground,
at the place of landing, was a level expanse
of green turf, which had been laid there
weeks before. This was partly arranged for
archery grounds, while rustic seats and swings
were to be found under every tree. A large platform
for open-air dancing, was placed at the foot
of the first ridge from the landing, while near by
was an enclosed dancing-hall, to be used in the
evening. Two bands were in attendance to play
dance music constantly, one resting while the
other played. It was understood that dinner
would be served, at four o'clock exactly, in a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
dining-room near the dancing-hall, and at that
time every one was to unmask.</p>

<p>As the party spread over the grounds and began
to enjoy all the opportunities for pleasure
afforded them, they presented a most novel appearance.
There were representatives, both male
and female, of nearly every known nationality,
and all the leading characters of historical and
fictional literature were admirably delineated.
Of course, among such members there were
many accidental repetitions of the same character,
but there were also instances of <i>fac similes</i>,
which were intentional. This was a frequent
cause of mistakes and embarrassing adventures,
and often, when a gay cavalier was talking in
tender tones to some lovely señorita whom he believed
he knew, he would be astonished to see a
second señorita, exactly like the first, passing unconcernedly
by.</p>

<p>The afternoon was spent in rowing, sailing,
shooting, dancing, and flirting, and all agreed
that they had never known a more truly delightful
day. An elegant lunch was kept ready at all
times in a large <i>buffet</i>, adjoining the dining-room,
and all kinds of wines and liquors were served
freely. The hour for dinner was fast approaching,
and, of course, by that time, many recognitions
had been made, though large numbers still
carefully and successfully preserved their own
secrets; some, however, had already abandoned
their masks, still retaining the fancy costumes.
Among these was Mr. Mather, who wandered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
over the island half distraught. He had vainly
searched for the Donna all day, and had been unable
to enjoy anything because he could not distinguish
her. Often he had believed he had
found her, but again and again he had discovered
that he was mistaken; so he continued his search
without his mask, hoping that she would make
herself known to him. At last he approached
Lesparre, just before four o'clock.</p>

<p>"My dear Lesparre," he asked, in imploring
tones, "I beg that you will tell me how to recognize
Donna Lucia. I have talked with every person
who could possibly be taken for her, and I
acknowledge that she is so perfectly disguised
that I cannot discover her. Won't you please
tell me how she is dressed?"</p>

<p>"That I do not know myself," replied Lesparre.
"She was very careful to keep the
knowledge from me, for fear I might be teased
into telling some one."</p>

<p>"Well, how is the Don dressed, then?" asked
Mather. "Perhaps he will tell me about the
Donna."</p>

<p>"I do not know how he is dressed, either," answered
Lesparre. "He was as secret in his
preparations as his wife."</p>

<p>"What! haven't you seen him to speak to
since the <i>fête</i> commenced?" inquired Mather, in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"No, I have not seen him since last night,"
said Lesparre. "You see, the Don and I made
all arrangements yesterday afternoon, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
came down to the island to superintend the placing
of the fireworks in the evening. I spent the
night down here, and have not gone back to the
house since I left it after dinner yesterday evening.
The Don has not spoken to me to-day, and,
for all that I know about him, he may not have
come to his own <i>fête</i>."</p>

<p>Lesparre said this in a jocular manner, as
though he had made quite an impossible supposition;
but Mather seemed to catch an idea from
it.</p>

<p>"By Jove! I begin to think so myself," he
exclaimed, as if confirming a thought which had
already occurred to him.</p>

<p>Just then Judge Morgan, dressed to represent
the Fat Boy of the Pickwick Papers, rang a large
bell, which could be heard all over the island,
and the guests began flocking into the dancing-hall,
preparatory to unmasking and having a
grand march into the dining-room. When all
were present, the bustle and talk quieted down,
and all looked expectantly for the Don to give
the signal for unmasking. Several of the intimate
friends of the host had assembled on the
<i>dais</i> at the head of the hall; and each of these
looked at the others to see which among them
was the Don. At last, Mather stepped forward
and addressed the whole company:</p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen, somewhere among us
are the host and hostess of this, the most elegant
entertainment ever given in Gloster; they have
been successful not only in producing here a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
fairy spectacle of unequaled beauty, but also in
effectually hiding themselves from discovery in
their assumed characters. So far as I know, not
any person present can state positively the disguise
of either Don Pedro or Donna Lucia. Am
I right? If any one has discovered either of
them, I ask him to let us all know it before the
signal for unmasking is given."</p>

<p>Mr. Mather waited a moment amid profound
stillness, but no one replied to his request.</p>

<p>"Well, now," he continued, "I respectfully
call upon the Don and Donna to come forward
to the <i>dais</i>, assume their rightful positions as
host and hostess, and give the order to unmask."</p>

<p>Alas! he was calling upon a pair of unfortunate
travelers, who were then far on their way to New
York, one in irons, and the other in tears. There
was no answer nor movement among the gay
masqueraders, and whispers of wonder began to
run through the throng.</p>

<p>"Oh! come, Don Pedro," said Judge Morgan,
whose appetite called loudly to be satisfied, "you
have shown that your disguise defies discovery;
now come forward and take your place. You
can laugh at our dullness all you please, but don't
keep us in suspense any longer."</p>

<p>Still there was no reply, and the astonishment
of all the guests began to assume a form of vague
suspicion. At length, Mather again spoke up, in
a husky voice:</p>

<p>"As our host is so retiring, I will take the
liberty of asking those present to unmask, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
we shall then discover his disguise. Tap the bell,
Morgan."</p>

<p>Judge Morgan immediately pulled the bell-rope
three times, and, as this was the concerted signal,
a gun was fired on board the steamer, and the
band struck up a spirited march. The confusion
of unmasking was quickly over, and the guests
formed a long procession around two sides of the
hall, preparatory to marching to dinner; but on
the <i>dais</i> the confusion only increased, as face after
face was revealed, and neither host nor hostess
was to be found. Robert Harrington, Charlie Morton,
Captain and Mrs. Kerr, Alexander McIntyre,
Judge Taylor, Mr. and Mrs. Benson, Mr. and
Mrs. Simon, Charles H. Sanders, wife and daughter,
Deacon Humphrey and daughter, John Preston
and family, and several others, were there,
but not a trace could be seen of Don Pedro P. L.
de Morito and Donna Lucia.</p>

<p>"Where in the devil is the Don?" was the
forcible manner in which Charlie Morton expressed
the sentiments of all present.</p>

<p>The absence of the host and hostess could not
fail to cause great confusion at any time, but, in
this instance, there seemed to be a host of suspicions
flying about in a few minutes. Madame
Sevier's absence was also noted, and a sort of
panic seized every one. No movement toward
the dining-room was made, but all stood irresolute,
anxiously waiting for some one to determine
what to do, and set them an example. Lesparre
was sought for and questioned closely as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
reason for his employer's absence, but he could
give no satisfactory answer. He told all inquirers
that he had not seen the Don since the
evening previous, and that he was as ignorant of
the cause of his absence as any one. Then
several questions relative to the Don's pecuniary
affairs were asked, and Lesparre told all that he
knew. The fact that the Don had exhausted his
bank account, and had kept all his money in his
own possession, set a good many people to thinking
about the circumstances of his arrival there.
Then the stockholders in the Diamond Company
began to grow suspicious, and it took but a few
minutes to put them in such a state of vague
uneasiness, that they hardly knew what to believe
of the man whom they so lately admired
and honored. At length, a consultation was
held among some of the more intimate friends of
the Morito family, and it was decided to go in to
dinner as if nothing had happened. If there had
been any accidental detention of the Don and
Donna, they would, of course, be desirous that
the <i>fête</i> should proceed without them the same
as if they had been present; while if there was
any trickery connected with their absence, there
would be no use of waiting for them to come
Accordingly, the procession was again formed,
the band struck up another march, and the party
proceeded toward the dining-room, headed by
Henry O. Mather with Mrs. Simon, and Richard
Perkins with Miss Benson.</p>

<p>But now occurred the most humiliating part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
the changed programme: Mr. George P. Westerfield,
the caterer, refused to admit the guests to
the dining-room unless the payment of his bill
was guaranteed. Mr. Westerfield was a man of
uncommon shrewdness. He had been accustomed
to furnishing the suppers at the grand entertainments
of the city for several years, and he
was well acquainted with the circumstances of
every person in the social world; hence, he had
seen a great deal of the Don and Donna during
their stay in the city. He had no more reason to
suspect them of having taken flight than the
others, but his native keenness and good judgment
led him to protect himself, and he resolutely
declined to open the dining-room doors unless his
bill was guaranteed. An animated discussion immediately
arose between Mr. Westerfield and the
hungry guests; but nothing would induce him to
change his resolve. He said that he was already
out of pocket largely by the lunch he had served
during the afternoon, and he could not afford to
lose his dinner too.</p>

<p>"But Don Pedro will pay for everything," said
Mr. Mather. "He is immensely wealthy, and he
always pays cash promptly for all he buys."</p>

<p>"Yes, that may have been true heretofore, but
how do I know where Don Pedro is?" queried the
caterer.</p>

<p>"Why, he is probably accidentally detained in
Gloster," replied Mather. "I have every confidence
in him, and when he explains his unfortunate
absence to-day, those who have suspected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
him will regret their hasty remarks derogatory
to his character."</p>

<p>"Well, then, Mr. Mather," said the shrewd caterer,
"if you have every confidence in Don Pedro,
you can give me your guarantee that I shall
be paid in full, and then I shall be happy to serve
the guests the same as if the Don were here."</p>

<p>Mr. Mather hesitated a moment, and then refused
to do anything of the kind. He was, undoubtedly,
so disturbed in mind that he hardly
knew what he was doing. If he had kept his
wits about him, he would not have hesitated an
instant to take the whole expense of the <i>fête</i> on
his own shoulders rather than have such a scene
occur as seemed imminent, for the sum would
have been a mere bagatelle to him; but he knew
not what to think, and his suspicions ran far
ahead of those of any other person present. He
had on his shoulders the whole responsibility of
this man, Don Pedro, for he had invited him to
Gloster, and had largely vouched for his character;
hence, if Don Pedro should prove to be a swindler,
a great deal of blame would fall upon Mather.
This feeling contributed largely to confuse and
annoy him, while his passion for the Donna was
another cause of embarrassment. He therefore
acted in a most nervous, uncertain way, and
seemed quite unable to decide what to do. Mr.
Westerfield's proposition was reasonable enough,
and he was willing to accept the guarantee of any
other gentleman of known responsibility; but
singularly, there was not one among all who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
been intimate with the Don who would make himself
liable for the cost of the dinner; consequently
the caterer refused to admit the throng
into the dining-room. By this time every one was
worked up into a state of righteous indignation.
The apprehensions of the owners of Diamond
Company stock were the first causes of the feeling
against the Don, and the disappointing termination
of the long-anticipated <i>fête</i> was another
fruitful source of bitterness. As people's appetites
began to call loudly for dinner, it became
evident that the caterer's demands must be satisfied
in some way, and finally it was agreed that
the dinner should be paid for by those who partook
of it at the rate of ten dollars a plate. This
amount was to include the lunch and wine already
furnished, and also all the provisions for
dinner with the remainder of the wine provided
under the contract with Don Pedro. Under this
agreement, the dinner was served in the best possible
style to the long array of famished and irritated
masqueraders. It was not a very cheerful
meal, for too many of the participants were preoccupied
with thoughts of their possibly lost investments
in the stock of the Diamond Company;
but, under the influence of excellent viands and
good wine, there was a slight reaction in the feelings
of the younger members of the party, and
when the last course had been served, they proposed
to go on with the entertainment the same
as though nothing had happened.</p>

<p>On entering the dancing-hall, therefore, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
greater portion of the young people prepared to
enjoy the evening in dancing; but here again an
obstacle presented itself: the bandsmen had taken
alarm from the action of the caterer, and they
refused to play unless their account was settled.
Not a note would they sound until their demands
were satisfied, and so the gentlemen contributed,
jointly, enough to pay them in full also. The
troubles and annoyances of the later portion of the
<i>fête</i> were soon forgotten by the greater number
of the butterflies who formed the assembly, and
as they floated off to the strains of a beautiful
waltz, they unanimously decided to spend the
evening in a delightful dance.</p>

<p>Meantime, however, many of the more staid
and elderly guests, having decided to go home
immediately after dinner, had gone down to the
steamboat landing to embark. To their astonishment
they saw the steamer tied up on the
opposite shore, her lights being just visible across
the water. After various attempts to hail her,
a reply was heard from a small boat, which contained
the captain. He pulled in near the shore,
and Judge Morgan, in an important tone, ordered
him to bring his steamer across the river and
convey a party back to Gloster.</p>

<p>"But who is going to pay me for the use of my
steamer all day?" asked the captain, resting on
his oars, within easy talking distance of the
shore. Alas! he, also, had determined to follow
the example of the caterer, and demand payment
for his services before admitting the excursionists
on board his steamer.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pay you" exclaimed the horrified Ethan
Allen Benson, who had paid so much for his dinner
that his miserly soul was already repenting
having come; "why, Don Pedro will pay you, of
course."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd like to see him, then," said the captain.</p>

<p>An exciting conversation then ensued between
the indignant would-be passengers and the captain
of the steamer. The latter, however, had
all the advantage, for he knew the masqueraders
must eventually come to his terms.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by refusing to take us on
board?" demanded Deacon Humphrey, furiously.
"Don't you know that we can't stay here all
night?"</p>

<p>"I presume not," said the captain, "and I
don't suppose you will do so; but I must have
payment for the use of my steamer. You can pay
me in one sum by a check, or you can pay me at
the rate of three dollars a head: I don't care
which you choose, only I must be paid."</p>

<p>The altercation continued at some length, and
eventually the captain said that he could not afford
to waste coal in keeping steam up, and if they
did not agree to his terms, he would haul fires
and let his steamer stay where she was all night.
This threat brought the party to his terms, and
he was ordered to bring his steamer over. He
refused to make more than one trip, however,
and so the dancers were called away from the
ballroom at the end of the first waltz, thus spoil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a><br /><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a><br /><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>ing
their gayety almost ere it had begun. As the
motley groups gathered on shore awaiting the
steamer's approach, a more deeply disgusted and
indignant assemblage was never known in the
annals of good society, and curses, both openly
and inwardly expressed against the Don, were
numerous and bitter. As they passed over the
gangway, the captain and clerk were at hand to
collect fares, and no one was allowed to pass without
paying cash or giving a check for the amount,
indorsed by some well-known man of wealth
and position. Finally, the whole sorrowful party
was embarked, and the steamer turned her head
toward Gloster. The excitement and continuous
dancing, which most of those on board had indulged
in during the day, had left them in a state
of nervous and physical fatigue little calculated
to improve their spirits, while the financial losses
of many were matters of an intensely depressing
influence upon them. A more ill-tempered, disappointed,
and irritable cargo cannot be imagined.
Their troubles were not ended even on their arrival
at the wharf in Gloster, for, being so much
earlier in returning than they had expected, no carriages
were in attendance, and the ladies were
obliged to wait on board while their escorts went
to the livery stables to order carriages to take
them home.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <i>"What do you mean by refusing to take us on board?" demanded Deacon Humphrey furiously.&mdash;Page&mdash;</i>]</p>

<p>Thus ended the <i>fête champêtre</i> which had been
anticipated so fondly as a new departure in the
social world of Gloster. In this, however, it was
a success; for, certainly, its like had never been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
seen before, and the guests were profoundly hopeful
that they never should see its like again.</p>

<p>The following morning the whole city was
talking of the flight of the Peruvian adventurers.
Their late residence was besieged by the
holders of Diamond Company stock, and the fact
of their absence was then clearly established.
The servants had been paid off by Madame Sevier
a day or two before, and no one remained in the
house except Lesparre. To all inquirers he gave
the same answer as he had given at the <i>fête</i>: he
was entirely ignorant of the whereabouts of the
Don, and was as anxious as any one else to find
him, in order to obtain his last quarter's salary,
which was unpaid. The affair was a nine-days'
wonder, and the mystery was still further increased
in the minds of the stockholders on receiving
a note from Judge Key requesting their
attendance at a meeting to settle their accounts
with Don Pedro. The meeting was strictly confidential,
only the actual purchasers of stock being
admitted. Judge Key explained to them that
Don Pedro P. L. de Morito had been arrested and
carried away for forgery and other crimes, but
that, before going, he had assigned all his property
to Judge Key to satisfy the claims of the
Diamond Company stockholders.</p>

<p>"But how did you induce him to surrender
this money and property?" was the question
which was asked in various forms nearly a score
of times.</p>

<p>"I cannot give you any particulars," replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
the Judge; "you must be satisfied to know that
he made this assignment in due legal form, and
that the amount which I shall realize will pay
your claims nearly in full. The slight loss which
you will sustain will be serviceable as a warning
against throwing away your money so recklessly
hereafter."</p>

<p>The letter of Donna Lucia to Mr. Henry O.
Mather was delivered to that gentleman early
the day after the <i>fête</i>. Immediately on reading
it he packed his trunk and took the next train
for New York. Meantime the party under the
charge of Mr. Bangs arrived in New York without
accident Thursday afternoon. In accordance
with telegrams sent by the Peruvian Minister,
the captain of the Peruvian man-of-war had
taken his vessel down into the lower harbor, and
was ready to sail at a moment's notice. A steam-tug
was in readiness at Pier 1 to take the party
out to the vessel, and Don Pedro was transferred
by carriage directly from the Hudson River Railroad
dépôt to the steam-tug. The party accompanied
him on board the man-of-war, and the
tug towed the war-ship through the Narrows.</p>

<p>The Don and Donna had an affectionate and
sorrowful parting in the cabin, and as the ship
made sail outside the bar, the tug dropped alongside;
the Minister, Consul, Donna Lucia, Madame
Sevier, and the detectives, leaving the Don in
charge of the captain, then returned to New
York in the tug.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span></p>

<p>Two days later, Mr. Mather also arrived in
that city, and quickly found his way to the Donna's
presence. What they said to each other
may never be known, but it is probable that
the interview was satisfactory to both parties.
Thenceforward the Donna lived in New York in
the best style, though for some reason she failed
to enter the same social circle that she had
known before. As long, however, as she and
Mr. Mather were contented, they considered that
no one else need be troubled about their arrangements.
How long Mr. Mather's infatuation
lasted, I have no means of knowing, as I soon
recalled Madame Sevier, and lost all interest in
the affair.</p>

<p>José Gomez was tried immediately on his arrival
in Peru, and was sentenced to fifteen years'
imprisonment, but he made his escape within
two years from the time of his trial. His future
career I never learned, but it is altogether probable
that he pursued, during the remainder of his
life, the same style of money-making (though
perhaps on a smaller scale) as that which rendered
notorious the name of Don Pedro P. L.
de Morito.</p>

</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Mr. Pinkerton, at a Water-Cure, becomes interested in a
Couple, one of whom subsequently causes the Detective
Operation from which this Story is written.&mdash;A
wealthy Ship-Owner and his Son.&mdash;The Son

<p>During the summer of 1870, I was spending
a few weeks at a water-cure for the benefit
of my health. The place was one not widely advertised
nor generally known, and the number of
frequenters was not large; hence, I became somewhat
acquainted with most of the visitors, and,
as a matter of habit, noticed their traits and peculiarities
with more attentiveness than a casual
meeting would naturally warrant. Of course I
had no idea that I ever should make any use of
my observations, but I simply kept up a customary
oversight upon everything about me.
Among those whom I thus noticed was a lady,
about forty-five years of age, and her son, who
was about twenty-six years old. The mother,
Mrs. R. S. Trafton, was a pleasant woman, well
preserved, and comparatively youthful in appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>ance.
She was afflicted by a rheumatic affection,
which caused her to visit these springs for relief;
and her son accompanied her partly to look after
her comfort, and partly to obtain a vacation from
work. He was a tall, robust young man, with
fine physique and strong constitution, but he
showed the effects of overwork. I always make
a point of observing the character and habits of
those around me, and long experience has given
me considerable accuracy of judgment with regard
to my acquaintances, even where I am not
an intimate associate with them. The more I
saw of Stanley D. Trafton, the more I was interested
in him. His mother was devoted to him,
and he to her, so that they were rarely seen
apart.</p>

<p>Springville was a very quiet, dull place, and,
aside from the invalid visitors, there was nothing
about the society to relieve the usual monotony
of an uninteresting country town; hence, I was
thrown largely upon my own resources for amusement,
and I had little else to do except to observe
the different strangers and speculate about them.
Among them all there were none who afforded
me a more interesting study than young Trafton,
and, although I never formed his acquaintance,
I began to feel that I understood his character
quite thoroughly.</p>

<p>He was about five feet ten inches in height, of
compact, muscular build, full chest, stout limbs,
and erect carriage. His complexion was clear
and healthy, his features regular, his expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
intelligent and open, and his manners were very
frank and attractive to most people. His general
appearance was that of an intelligent, handsome
man, of more than ordinary ability and steady
character.</p>

<p>I learned that his father, Mr. Richard S.
Trafton, of Cleveland, was a wealthy ship-owner
and merchant, and that his son attended largely
to the purchase of grain in the West for shipment
in his father's vessels. I judged that
young Trafton was a good business man, with
an eye to details as well as general results, and
while he had no appearance of being small-minded,
he did not despise economy in his
business affairs. He did not seem like a person
who would spend money for mere display or
effect; yet, neither would he deny himself the
comforts and luxuries belonging to a man of his
wealth and position in society. There was
nothing of the profligate about him, and his
devotion to his mother showed that he must
have a genuine and hearty respect for the whole
sex.</p>

<p>In the course of a few weeks I left Springville,
much improved in health, and I soon forgot all
about Mrs. Trafton and her son, until the latter
was brought under my notice again amid very
tragical and sorrowful circumstances.</p>

<p>Early in the winter of the following year, I
was deeply engrossed in business, having an accumulation
of cases on hand which taxed my ingenuity
and energies to the utmost. I therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
placed almost all of the less important operations
in the hands of my superintendent, Mr. Francis
Warner, though I kept a general supervisory
control over every case on the books of the
Agency. One morning, as I was conversing with
Mr. Warner, two gentlemen were admitted to my
office by my confidential clerk, who informed me
that they had suspicions of foul play as the cause
of the death of one of their friends, and they
wished the circumstances fully investigated by
the Agency. The gentlemen were Mr. John Updike,
of Cleveland, and Captain Edward R. Dalton,
a ship captain, of Buffalo. They introduced
themselves, produced credentials and references,
and then told me the following story:</p>

<p>In November previous, Mr. Stanley D. Trafton,
of Cleveland, left that city to go to Chicago. He
was the son of Mr. Richard S. Trafton, a wealthy
shipper of Cleveland, and the father was anxious
to keep his vessels employed. Captain Dalton
commanded one of Mr. Trafton's schooners, and
he expected to arrive in Chicago harbor about
November 20. Accordingly, young Trafton was
to meet the vessel there, and, in case she did not
obtain a charter at a paying rate, he was to purchase
a cargo of oats on his own account. He
brought, therefore, a considerable amount of
money and negotiable paper. He had about
eight hundred dollars in currency, two thousand
five hundred dollars in United States five-twenty
bonds, and a letter from his father authorizing
him to draw upon him for a large amount. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
bonds were the usual coupon bonds of the denomination
of five hundred dollars each, and fortunately
Mr. Trafton, senior, had the numbers of
these securities.</p>

<p>Stanley Trafton arrived in Chicago November
22, and found the schooner awaiting him. He
tried to obtain a room in one of the hotels, but
he soon gave this up as a hopeless task, for the
reason that there was no hotel in the city which
was not already crowded almost to an unsafe degree.
He then took up his quarters on board the
schooner, getting his meals at a restaurant. This
was not at all pleasant, and he finally discovered
a place where furnished rooms were to let near
one of the hotels. He therefore announced to
Captain Dalton that he had taken a room at 92
West Madison street. They met each other every
day, however, and at last, seeing no profit to be
made by purchasing grain in the then condition
of the market, Mr. Trafton informed the captain
that he might sail for Cleveland on Friday, December
1. On Thursday he visited the captain
and promised to return on board again that evening;
he failed to do so, however, and the schooner
sailed next morning.</p>

<p>Five days afterward, Captain Dalton received a
dispatch, sent by a firm of commission merchants
in Chicago, announcing that Stanley D. Trafton
had been found dead in his bed. Mr. Updike,
who was a warm friend of the family, and Captain
Dalton, then visited Chicago, arriving December
8. They found the body of Mr. Trafton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
at the Morgue awaiting claimants, together with
a quantity of valuables which had been in his
possession when he died. There were two five-twenty
bonds, one being torn in two pieces, a set
of diamond studs, a small amount of loose change,
and three one-hundred-dollar bills. A coroner's
inquest had been held, and a verdict of death by
congestion of the lungs had been rendered.</p>

<p>The circumstances of young Trafton's death,
as related by the officials in charge of the body,
created considerable suspicion in the minds of
Messrs. Updike and Dalton, who, therefore, proceeded
to investigate the affair. In the first
place, they were well aware that fifteen hundred
dollars in bonds, and nearly five hundred dollars
in currency, were missing; secondly, they learned
that Trafton had been found dead in bed Friday
morning, December 1, only about eighteen hours
after he had left Captain Dalton in perfect
health.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Mr. Updike and Captain Dalton
visited his late lodging-place, which was kept by
a woman named May Sanford.</p>

<p>The building was a two-story frame residence,
which, like thousands of others after the Great
Fire, had been rearranged for business purposes.
The lower floor was occupied as a furniture store,
while the second floor was also partly occupied
by business offices. A covered stairway on the
side led to the upper story, and, while the front
hall bedroom, the front parlor and the next
room back, were used as offices, the rear portion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a><br /><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>was occupied by Mrs. Sanford, who rented most
of her rooms as sleeping apartments.</p>

<p>[Illustration: <i>"He was lying in bed with froth about his mouth and a ghastly look on his face."&mdash;Page&mdash;</i>]</p>

<p>On stating their object in calling, the two
gentlemen were admitted to Mrs. Sanford's sitting-room,
and she then gave her account of the
circumstances connected with young Trafton's
death. She stated that she met him first on the
street and recognized him as an old acquaintance
who had been intimate with her husband and
herself when they lived in Buffalo; that he stopped
and talked with her for a time, and, learning that
she had furnished rooms to let, he said he would
rent one. He stayed there five days, and, on the
sixth, which was Thursday, November 30, he
came to his room in the evening and complained
of feeling unwell. He had been drinking very
hard all the week, and she said that this evening
he was quite drunk. He complained that he
could not keep anything on his stomach, and
asked Mrs. Sanford to cook something nice for
him. Accordingly she boiled a chicken, but he
could not eat it, and he then went to bed. During
the evening, she heard him snoring very
loudly as she passed his door, but she thought
nothing of it, and went to bed at eleven o'clock.
About seven o'clock next morning, she knocked
at his door, but he made no answer, and she
pushed the door open, the bolt being a very slight
one. She then found Mr. Trafton lying diagonally
across the bed, with his head hanging down
and froth on his lips. Becoming alarmed at his
appearance, she called in a gentleman named<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
Taylor G. Pratt, who occupied her back parlor as
a real estate office and sleeping-room. Mr. Pratt
examined the body of Mr. Trafton and told her
that he was dead, advising her to inform the
police authorities of the fact. She immediately
closed the room and went to the nearest police
station, where she reported the circumstances
relative to the death of Mr. Trafton so far as she
knew them, and asked what she should do with
the body. The police sergeant promised to send
the coroner as soon as possible to make an investigation,
and she was instructed to leave the body
and room untouched until the coroner should
arrive. That evening an inquest was held by the
County Physician, and a verdict of death by
congestion of the lungs was rendered. Mrs.
Sanford gave an account of the finding of the
money and bonds, which exactly agreed with
that given by the County Physician, whom she
assisted in making search for Trafton's valuables.
In one boot, lying under his head, they found a
five-twenty bond for five hundred dollars and
half of another one, the remainder of this torn
bond being found in the right-hand pocket of his
pantaloons. In his vest pocket were found three
United States notes for one hundred dollars each,
and a small quantity of loose change. A set of
diamond studs still remained in his shirt, and, as
the story was related by her, there was nothing
suspicious about the affair except the suddenness
of his death.</p>

<p>Having heard all that Mrs. Sanford and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
County Physician had to say on the subject, Mr.
Updike and Captain Dalton took charge of the
body, and shipped it to Cleveland, where they
placed it in the hands of four experienced surgeons,
with instructions to make a thorough and
careful examination as to the cause of death.
The first thing noticed by them was an evidence
of considerable external violence on the right
side, over the liver, there being a large bruise,
about the size of a saucer, apparently caused by
a blow. The coagulation of blood beneath the
skin showed that this injury must have been
caused during Trafton's lifetime, but very
shortly before his death. A similar, though
smaller bruise, was found on his thigh, while several
bruises on the base of the neck and throat
showed that the windpipe must have been
severely compressed just previous to death.
None of these marks had been noticed by the
County Physician in making the post-mortem
examination, and it seemed probable that he had
first guessed at the cause of death, and then
made only a sufficient examination to find some
corroboration of his theory. The Cleveland surgeons
had great difficulty in accounting for Trafton's
death, but they were unanimous in scouting
the theory of death by congestion of the
lungs. They found the body to be healthy in
every part, except the external bruises; and,
while these were not of a sufficiently serious
character to account for the death of so robust a
man, they could find no other cause whatever.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
These facts, together with the disappearance of
fifteen hundred dollars in bonds, and about five
hundred dollars in currency, which Trafton was
known to have had in his possession, caused his
relatives and friends to believe that he had been
murdered for his money, and that the murderer
had been shrewd enough to leave a large portion
of the plunder to allay suspicion. The trick had
proven to be a most excellent one, for, as the
County Physician afterward acknowledged, the
idea of foul play never occurred to him, owing to
the apparent lack of incentive thereto; had there
been no money, or only a small amount, found
on the body, he would have made a much more
rigid examination; but no suspicion even crossed
his mind, and he acted with the haste which
characterized almost all operations in Chicago at
that time.</p>

<p>In order, therefore, to discover all the facts in
the case, and to recover, if possible, the missing
money and bonds, Mr. Trafton, senior, had
decided to put the affair in my hands for a
thorough investigation, and Mr. Opdike and Captain
Dalton had called upon me for that purpose.</p>

<p>Having heard their statement, I asked a number
of questions, which elicited the following
additional information:</p>

<p>On returning to Chicago the second time, they
had again visited Mrs. Sanford, and found that
she had taken every particle of furniture out of
the room where Trafton had died. At the time
of their call, they saw a policeman whom she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
called Charlie, with whom she seemed to be very
intimate. She said that Charlie was the first
person to see Trafton after she found he was
dead that morning, he having been sent over by
the sergeant as soon as she reported the fact.
This story contradicted her former statement,
that she first called Mr. Pratt into the room;
moreover, the sergeant of police had told them
that the policeman did not go to the room at all,
but merely took the number of the house and
went away.</p>

<p>At this interview, Mrs. Sanford gave them the
blank power to draw upon Mr. Trafton, senior,
saying that she had found it at the foot of the
bed since their former visit. She also showed
them a gold coin which she said young Trafton
had given her as a keepsake. Both gentlemen
recognized this coin as one which Trafton prized
very highly for some reason, he having refused
to part with it even to his mother; it seemed
hardly possible that he should have given it to a
chance acquaintance like Mrs. Sanford.</p>

<p>During this conversation she claimed to have
lent Mr. Trafton three hundred and twenty-five
dollars, though she did not seem greatly disappointed
when they refused to repay her that
amount. Mr. Updike gave her twenty-five dollars,
however, to pay for Mr. Trafton's board and
lodging, and to recompense her for her trouble.
The story that Trafton had borrowed money of
her was absurd on its face, and she acted as if
she hardly expected to be believed.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>Before coming to Chicago this time, Mr. Updike
had written to Mr. T. B. Vernon, of Buffalo,
asking for information relative to the antecedents
of this Mrs. Sanford. Mr. Vernon had replied
that she had a very bad reputation in Buffalo,
having been divorced from her husband for
adultery, and having been arrested in March
previous for being drunk and disorderly. She
had a paramour at that time, named James McSandy,
a police-station keeper, and it was supposed
that he had gone West with her.</p>

<p>Another circumstance had been noticed by
Captain Dalton, which led him to believe that
Trafton had been murdered with his clothes on,
and afterward undressed and put to bed: the sole
of one of his boots was covered with whitewash,
as if it had been violently pressed and scraped
along a wall. Now, the room where he was
found had been newly whitewashed when they
arrived there, so that any marks on the wall
made by him in his struggles would be wholly
obliterated.</p>

<p>Having learned all the facts bearing upon the
case known by my visitors, I informed them of
my terms for conducting an investigation of this
character, and sketched a hasty outline of my
plan of operation. As they had already hinted
their suspicions to a member of the city detective
force, who was inclined to make light of them, I
suggested that they inform him that they had
changed their minds in the matter, having
learned from the Cleveland physicians that death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
was surely caused by congestion of the lungs.
They then took their departure, saying that they
would lay my plan before Mr. Richard S. Trafton,
and he would telegraph to me whether I should
proceed with the operation. On Christmas day,
I received a telegram from Mr. Trafton, briefly
instructing me to proceed, and my plan was put
in operation at once.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further with the history of
my connection with this case, it will be necessary
to remind the reader of the anomalous condition
of social and business affairs in Chicago at the
time of which I write; for, without any explanation,
he might have difficulty in understanding
many things in connection with the story.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the Great Fire of
Chicago occurred October 8 and 9, 1871, and this
case was placed in my hands only about nine
weeks afterward. At the time of Mr. Trafton's
death, a pall of smoke hung over the city, and, at
night, the still-smouldering heaps of coal throughout
the "burned district" glowed like volcanic
fissures, casting a weird fantastic light about the
ruins, and illumining the clouds of smoke overhead
with a ruddy glow which was visible for
miles away. The streets were filled with dust
and ashes, while the fumes of carbonic acid gas
were sometimes almost stifling. To venture, at
any time, into the waste of ruins, which stretched
more than three miles in one direction, through
the formerly richest portion of the city, was not
a pleasant undertaking; but to make such an ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>cursion
at night was attended with more hazard
than most peaceably-disposed men would care to
run. There were no gaslights, no sidewalks, no
street indicators; in many places, piles of stone
and brick were heaped in almost impassable barricades
from one side of the street to the other;
all landmarks were gone, and the old resident
was as liable to lose his way as the stranger.</p>

<p>The city, moreover, was crowded with what
is sometimes called "a floating population," a
species of driftwood, or scum, gathered from
every quarter of the globe; indeed, a large percentage
seemed to have come straight from the
infernal regions, with all the passions and habits
incidental to a prolonged residence there. Hence,
the labors of the police force were increased to
an extent which taxed their abilities to the
utmost, and made the task of protecting the respectable
portion of the community about all that
could be required of them; that they should be apt
to suspect foul play, in a case where the coroner had
no suspicions, was hardly to be expected. Besides
this, there was nothing settled on any permanent
foundation; business men flitted hither and
thither wherever they could best obtain accommodations
for the time being, and whence people
came or whither they went was a matter which
no one had time to inquire into, much less to
investigate.</p>

<p>The destruction of thousands of business blocks
and dwellings left the city without adequate accommodations
for offices and residences, even for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
its own regular population; but when the rush of
strangers swelled the aggregate nearly twenty
per cent., there seemed hardly sleeping-rooms for
them all. Dwelling-houses by thousands were
converted into stores, manufactories, and offices,
until fabulous prices were offered for the merest
closets in the vicinity of the new temporary
business centers. Every hotel was thronged
from the basement to the Mansard roof, and late
arrivals were oftentimes happy if they could get
a straw mattress on a billiard-table, or an army
cot in a hall.</p>

<p>I call especial attention to these things to account
for certain apparent anomalies in the
action of different persons connected with this
tragedy. For instance: a young gentleman of
Mr. Trafton's wealth and respectability would
never have rented a mean little room in a petty
lodging-house, if he could have found any other
place equally convenient to business; the County
Physician would not have taken things so much
for granted, if he had not been so hard at work
and so pressed for time, owing to the immense
army of gratuitous patients who thronged the
offices of the County Agent and the Relief and
Aid Society; the police would not have been so
remiss in failing to examine into the death of
Mr. Trafton, if they had not had their hands full
of other business to an unprecedented extent;
and, lastly, when I came to work up the case, I
should not have had so much difficulty in finding
witnesses, if it had not been that people came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
and went through Chicago like the waves of the
sea in mid-ocean, leaving no trace by which they
could be followed or identified.</p>

<p>These circumstances, combined with certain
facts which will appear in the course of this narrative,
made the task assigned me one of unusual
difficulty. Mr. Warner was intrusted with the
general management of the case, though he frequently
consulted me in relation to it; and,
though we were continually working in the
dark, we never despaired of our eventual success.</p>

<p>The day after Christmas a tall, well-built man
called at No. 92 Madison street, and asked
for the lady of the house. Mrs. Sanford soon
entered the sitting-room, and the stranger said
that, having seen the sign, "Furnished Rooms
to Rent," he had called to engage lodgings. He
introduced himself as John Ingham, and said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
that he was a bookkeeper, temporarily out of
employment. Mrs. Sanford received him with
great cordiality, and seemed much pleased to have
him as a lodger. She said that she had no suitable
room just then, but that a married couple
were about to leave, and then Mr. Ingham could
have their room. She then showed him through
the house. The two front rooms were occupied
by an insurance company, and the back parlor
was used as a real estate office and sleeping-room
by two brothers, named Pratt. At the head of
the stairs was a small bedroom, through which
it was necessary to pass to obtain admission to
the rear part of the house. The passageway
from this bedroom to the sitting-room was made
by partitioning off a small entry from the back
parlor. There were four doors in this sitting-room:
one opened from the entry; at the opposite
side was one which opened into another entry;
the third was adjoining this second door, and it
opened into the large bedroom occupied by the
married couple; the fourth door led into Mrs.
Sanford's own room. At the end of the back
entry was an unfurnished room and a kitchen.
The front bedroom was occupied by two young
women who worked in a bindery, and their accommodations
could hardly have been very agreeable,
as every one was obliged to pass through
their room on the way to the other rooms in the
rear.</p>

<p>Mrs. Sanford was a good-looking woman, about
thirty-two years old. Her features were quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
pretty, and her expression was pleasing. She
was very plump, and her skin was smooth and
soft. She had brown hair, a nose slightly
<i>retroussé</i>, and a pleasant smile. Her eyes, however,
were a bluish gray, cold and watchful as
those of a hawk. She might have been called
handsome but for the effects of dissipation,
which were plainly visible in her face. She had
a pleasant voice, and she was naturally easy in
her manners. If she was in a good humor, she
could be quite fascinating; and almost any stranger,
after talking with her for a few minutes,
would feel satisfied that she had once occupied a
social station far above that in which she was
now placed. She had a good education, and very
frequently she would give evidences of having had
a wide range of really good reading. At times,
her recitations and declamations, wholly from
memory, were exceptionally fine, and, but for
her two ruling passions, she might have been an
actress of a high rank.</p>

<p>She had two controlling vices, one natural, the
other acquired: her greed for money was inborn,
and it seemed to absorb at times every other
faculty; while the habit of using morphine had
become so fastened upon her, that she could not
shake it off. She was a most contradictory medley
of compounds, however, and while her thirst
for money seemed to overpower all other considerations
with her as a general rule, on some occasions
she would be as wasteful and careless of
expense as the most prodigal woman in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
world. But when she had set her mind on the
acquisition of any particular money or piece of
personal property, there was no length to which
she would not go to attain her object. The mere
sight of money seemed to act upon her with an
effect almost of insanity, and she would then
have no regard for consequences until after she
had secured the coveted prize.</p>

<p>It will be readily understood, of course, that
Mr. John Ingham, usually known as Jack, was
one of my detectives, sent to obtain lodging with
Mrs. Sanford, to win her confidence and learn all
that he could.</p>

<p>Ingham agreed to take the large room in the
rear, but he wanted to come immediately. Mrs.
Sanford agreed, therefore, to make up a bed for
him on the sofa in the sitting-room until the departure
of Mr. and Mrs. Graves, who were then
occupying the back room. Having agreed upon
the terms, Ingham went away, promising to return
that night. Accordingly, he came in again
about nine o'clock in the evening, and found that
Mrs. Sanford was entertaining a policeman. He
was a rather good-looking fellow, and was in full
uniform, except his star. He remained until
nearly twelve o'clock, and when he went out,
Mrs. Sanford followed him to the door, with
many affectionate caresses and tender remarks.
After he had gone, she began to converse very
confidentially with Ingham, telling him that she
was engaged to be married to Charlie, the policeman.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't you think a policeman is good enough
to marry?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes!" replied Ingham, "and your Charlie
seems to be a fine fellow."</p>

<p>"Well, he is awfully fond of me," she continued,
"and he spends all his time off duty with
me; but I don't know whether I care to marry
him. What do you think about it, Mr. Ingham?"</p>

<p>"You ought not to be in any hurry about it,"
he replied, "for you might see some one whom
you would like better."</p>

<p>"Oh! I have had a number of offers lately," she
said, laughing. "I have had to work hard for a
living, and have saved up quite a good sum; and,
besides that, my father sent me two thousand
dollars a short time ago, so that I have a snug
little fortune. But Charlie doesn't know anything
about it, and I shan't tell him until after we
are married."</p>

<p>After some further conversation, she said that
she was hungry, and wished she had someone to
go to the nearest restaurant with. Ingham volunteered
to act as her escort, and they went out
together. While eating supper, she suddenly
asked whether government bonds were good
property to invest in. Ingham replied that they
were very good indeed, since the interest was
payable in gold, and there were no taxes to pay
upon them.</p>

<p>"Well, suppose you should lose them," she
queried; "could any one who found them make
use of them without being discovered?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I think so," said Ingham. "There is no
means of learning how they came into the bearer's
possession."</p>

<p>"Did you ever own any?" she inquired.</p>

<p>"No, but I used to cash the coupons for my
employer in Louisville, and I know a good deal
about them."</p>

<p>"What business were you in there?" she asked,
with a considerable show of interest.</p>

<p>"I was bookkeeper for a wholesale liquor
firm, and the senior partner used to put all his
money into government bonds."</p>

<p>"Why did you leave Louisville?" she continued,
seemingly desirous of learning as much as
possible of his history.</p>

<p>"Oh! well, I got hard up," he replied, evasively,
"and there was some mistake in my accounts
which I couldn't explain satisfactorily, so I
thought best to go out of town for awhile. You
know we are all liable to mistakes when we are
hard up."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, I understand," she replied, in a
satisfied tone of voice. "What are you going to
do here?"</p>

<p>"Well, I can't tell yet. I have a small job of
closing up a set of books for the year, and when
that is done I shall look around for something
else. I'm not particular what I do, if it pays
well."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you could get employment from the
Relief and Aid Society," she said, "and then you
could get lots of nice things for me. This man,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
Graves, whose room you are to have, is employed
there, and he steals enough to keep the
woman who is with him in good style."</p>

<p>"Why, aren't they married?" asked Ingham.</p>

<p>"No, I don't believe they are married," she replied,
"and I've given them notice to leave. Mr.
Graves gets hardly any pay, but he brings her
all kinds of presents, and she sells them to the
pawnbrokers."</p>

<p>On their return to the house, Mrs. Sanford
made up a bed on the sofa for Ingham, and then
went to her room.</p>

<p>The day following, Ingham went down to his
work on the South Side, and did not return until
eight o'clock in the evening. He said that he
knew of a chance to buy a cigar stand in one of
the leading hotels, and that he would like to do
it if he could raise the money. Mrs. Sanford
seemed to have taken a great fancy to her new
lodger, for she told him that she would assist
him, if it did not cost too much.</p>

<p>"By the way, I was sorry you were not here
this afternoon," she said. "There was a very
pretty young lady friend of mine here, and I
would like to have you meet her."</p>

<p>"What was her name?"</p>

<p>"Ida Musgrove."</p>

<p>"Have you known her long?"</p>

<p>"Oh! no, I have only lived in Chicago a few
months. I used to live in Cleveland before I
separated from my husband, and we had a fine
stone-front house there."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span></p>

<p>"How did you happen to leave your husband?"
asked Ingham.</p>

<p>"Well, he began running after other women,
and, though I forgave him several times, when
he brought his mistress to live in the same house
with me, I left him."</p>

<p>"He must have been a very hard case to do
such a thing as that," said Ingham, sympathizingly.</p>

<p>"Yes; and then he sold the house, promising
to give me half if I would sign the deed; but he
never gave me a cent, so that I have had to work
hard to support myself and my little girl, who is
boarding at Riverside. However, I am all right
now, for my father sent me three thousand dollars
the other day, and I shall have plenty of
money hereafter."</p>

<p>"Hadn't you any friends here who would have
helped you?" asked Ingham.</p>

<p>"No, I hardly knew any one; but I met an old
friend from Cleveland about a month ago, and he
died here in my house. Haven't I told you about
that?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed; how was it?"</p>

<p>"Well, you see, this Mr. Trafton was a former
lover of mine in Cleveland, and he was very rich
and handsome. He came here last month and
took the back room in my house. He was very
kind to me, and wanted to marry me; but he
drank hard for a week and began to show the
effects of his dissipation. Finally, he came home
one evening quite drunk, and he complained of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
feeling sick. I boiled a chicken for him, but he
could not eat it, and he went to bed. Next
morning he did not call me as usual, and I went
to his door and knocked; there was no answer,
and so I pushed open his door. He was lying in
bed with froth about his mouth and a ghastly
look on his face which frightened me terribly.
Then I called in Mr. Pratt, who roomed in the
back parlor, and he said that Mr. Trafton was
dead. When the coroner came, we found twenty-five
thousand dollars in Mr. Trafton's pockets,
besides his diamond studs and other property.
Oh! it was a dreadful thing for me to think that
such a handsome fellow as my Stanley should die
in my house."</p>

<p>"What was the matter with him?" asked Ingham.</p>

<p>"The coroner held an inquest, and a post-mortem
examination showed that he died of congestion
of the lungs."</p>

<p>"Did you know that he had all that money
with him?" asked Ingham, significantly lowering
his voice.</p>

<p>"No, I did not know it until afterward," she
replied; "why do you ask?"</p>

<p>"Oh! for no special reason; but," he added, in
a determined way, "you might have helped yourself
to some of that money and no one would
have been the wiser. I tell you, I wouldn't have
let such a chance as that slip."</p>

<p>"Well, I know I might have taken some of it,"
she answered, thoughtfully, "but I couldn't steal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
from him. Oh! I have mighty good credit
among people here now, for every one knows
about that money, and that I could have taken
it all if I had wished. A reporter came here, and
afterward stated in the paper that there was only
a small amount, about fifteen hundred dollars,
found; but I had it corrected."</p>

<p>She prattled on for some time about her intimacy
with Mr. Trafton, until she was interrupted
by a noise in the hall bedroom. On going to see
what was the matter, she found the two bindery
girls in great excitement, as they had been
awakened by a strange man in their room. Ingham
also went to the door, when Mrs. Sanford
told him to get his revolver, as she wanted to
shoot any man who should try to break into her
rooms. No one was found, but the lower hall
door was open, and Ingham went down to lock
it. On his return, Mrs. Sanford said that she
had a revolver, and that she knew how to use it
too. It was about midnight before they retired,
but Mrs. Sanford seemed to consider it quite an
early hour.</p>

<p>The next day Ingham was again absent until
evening, and Mrs. Sanford scolded him a little for
not staying more time with her. He replied that
he had been out looking for a chance to make a
raise.</p>

<p>"What kind of a raise?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh! any kind," he replied; "I'm not particular,
provided I can get enough to pay for the
trouble. If I knew of any good hiding place, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
could get a lot of valuable goods some night without
much work, and with no danger."</p>

<p>"You can bring them here, and I will hide
them so that they will never be found," she replied,
in a whisper.</p>

<p>"That will be a pretty hard thing to do, for
these policemen and detectives can find almost
anything if they want to. I shouldn't like to
bring any plunder here and then have it found in
your house, for you would then be punished for
receiving stolen goods.</p>

<p>"Never you fear about me; I know some sharp
tricks if I <i>am</i> a woman. I can hide anything you
bring, and if they get after you, I can hide you
too."</p>

<p>Ingham then told her about various criminal
devices for obtaining money, which he had practiced
in New York several years before, and
called her attention to the ease with which they
might rob strangers by the "panel" game. She
was very much interested, and said that she
could easily get hold of some fellow with plenty
of money, make him drunk, and then rob him.</p>

<p>"How I wish you had been here when Mr.
Trafton died, for you could have got away with
ten or fifteen thousand dollars without any difficulty
whatever."</p>

<p>"Yes, it would have been a good chance," he
replied; "but I guess we can do nearly as well,
if you will be true to me and help me."</p>

<p>"You can depend upon me for anything," she
answered, with great determination, but adding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
suddenly, in a cautious tone, "that is, anything
except murder, you know. I shouldn't like to do
that. But I would protect you even if you should
kill a man&mdash;not willfully&mdash;not willfully, you understand;
but if you should be obliged to do it to
save yourself, I should not blame you very
much."</p>

<p>"I am determined to 'make a raise,' soon,"
said Ingham; "but I don't know whether I can
trust you."</p>

<p>"How so?" she asked, as if greatly surprised.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you will 'give me away' to that
policeman whom you think so much of."</p>

<p>"You need not fear anything of the kind," she
said, leaning forward, and speaking slowly and
emphatically. "I can help you a great deal, and
I would never betray you to any one. I don't
think so much of Charlie as I pretend to."</p>

<p>Soon afterward she had to go into the unfurnished
room to get something, and she asked
Ingham to hold the light for her.</p>

<p>"Why can't you hold it yourself?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, to tell the truth, I don't like to go into
that room alone," she replied, trying to laugh in
an unconcerned way.</p>

<p>"Why not? You aren't afraid of anything,
are you?"</p>

<p>"No, not afraid; but I have never felt like going
in there since Mr. Trafton died there. I cannot
help recollecting the way he looked when I
first saw him hanging over the bedside, with the
froth on his lips. I took out all the furniture on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
that account, but I am going to furnish it again
next week, as I can get a good rent for it."</p>

<p>Ingham went with her as she requested, and
he noticed that all the time she was in the room
overhauling a trunk containing the things she
wanted, she was very restless and nervous. Several
times when she heard a sudden noise she
would start and turn pale, as if much frightened.</p>

<p>Presently the two girls occupying the front
room came in and said that they should leave
next day, as they were afraid of a man coming
into their room as one had done the night before.
Mrs. Sanford was evidently not sorry to have
them go, and they soon went to bed.</p>

<p>Ingham and Mrs. Sanford then talked together
about their plans for getting money for some
time. Her whole mind seemed bent upon one
object,&mdash;to obtain money; and she seemed to
have no scruples whatever as to the means employed.</p>

<p>"Don't you know of any wealthy fellow who
carries considerable money about with him?"
asked Ingham.</p>

<p>"Oh! yes; I know two or three who come
here to do business, and I expect one from Canada
next week. He always has plenty of money
with him, so that I have no doubt we could get
a big sum out of him."</p>

<p>"Does he ever drink?" he asked; "I don't
want to tackle a sober man, if I can help it."</p>

<p>"That needn't trouble you," she replied, in a
whisper; "I can give him something to keep him
quiet."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span></p>

<p>"How can you do that?" he inquired, with apparent
astonishment.</p>

<p>She then showed him a bottle of morphine, and
said that she always kept it for her own use, and
that she knew how to give just enough to produce
a deep sleep. They finally agreed to lay their
plans together, and to make a big haul at the first
opportunity.</p>

<p>Ingham went out again on his prospecting tour
next day, but when he returned, in the evening,
he had not discovered any good place for a robbery.
He told Mrs. Sanford, however, that he
thought he could get a quantity of counterfeit
money at a very low price, and that they could
pass a great deal of it, if they were skillful. She
liked the idea, and said that she could pass it on
a great many people who would never recollect
where they received it. She also said that she
had a good place to hide it, and that some time
she would show him where she had hidden some
property, when the police were looking for it.</p>

<p>"Oh! how I wish you had been here when
that man died with eighteen thousand dollars in
bonds in his pockets!" she exclaimed. "You
could have helped yourself to all you wanted."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," he replied, "I should have
made myself rich for life."</p>

<p>"But could you have disposed of the bonds
without being suspected?" she asked. "Wouldn't
his friends catch you if they had the numbers of
the bonds?"</p>

<p>"Oh! that wouldn't make any difference.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
There are millions of dollars afloat of these bonds,
and they cannot be traced any more than money."</p>

<p>"His bonds were all for five hundred dollars
each, and they had little tickets on the end, which
could be cut off for the interest," she said. "I
saw them when the coroner was examining
them."</p>

<p>"Yes, they were undoubtedly five-twenty
bonds, and were worth their face in gold."</p>

<p>"Well, another time, if we get such a chance,"
she said, "we will take enough to make ourselves
comfortable, and leave the rest to remove
suspicion."</p>

<p>On the following day, Ingham returned to his
room at Mrs. Sanford's about three o'clock in the
afternoon, and she told him that the two girls and
Mr. and Mrs. Graves had left. She said that she
had a great fuss with the latter, and that they
went away in a state of high wrath against her;
besides this, she had had a quarrel with Charlie,
the policeman, who had sided with Mrs. Graves
during their quarrel. Mrs. Sanford said, further,
that Charlie had acted very meanly in not making
her any Christmas or New Year's present,
and she didn't care whether he came there again
or not. She said that Mrs. Graves had left her
trunk to be called for, and that there was no doubt
she had stolen some of Mrs. Sanford's towels and
other things. She then went to the trunk, opened
it, and took out a number of articles, which she
said belonged to her. She took the articles into
the kitchen, and secreted them in a hole in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
floor, where she was able to take up a board.
Ingham thought it rather strange that she should
hide these things, if they were her own property,
but he said nothing on the subject to Mrs. Sanford.</p>

<p>About five o'clock a young lady called to see
Mrs. Sanford, and they seemed very intimate
with each other. When they entered the sitting-room,
Mrs. Sanford said:</p>

<p>"Ida, let me introduce to you Mr. Ingham; this
is Miss Ida Musgrove, Mr. Ingham."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Sanford has spoken of you in such complimentary
terms, Miss Ida," said Ingham, "that
I have been very anxious to meet you."</p>

<p>"Now, how can you be so foolish, May," said
Miss Ida, addressing Mrs. Sanford; "you always
talk about me so extravagantly that people are
very much disappointed when they meet me."</p>

<p>"Oh! that is quite impossible," chimed in
Ingham. "I am sure that Mrs. Sanford hardly
did you justice."</p>

<p>"I see, Mr. Ingham, that you are, like all the
rest of your sex, a great flatterer," simpered Miss
Ida, who was evidently greatly pleased with his
compliments, but who wished to appear too
modest to believe him to be in earnest.</p>

<p>Miss Ida was a brilliant brunette of fine features
and figure. She was stylish and graceful
in her appearance, and her dress showed remarkably
good taste. She was very vivacious
and merry, but a close observer would have
noticed that she was not endowed with much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
sentiment, and a physiognomist would have said
that she was more interested in the size of a man's
fortune than in his looks or powers to please.
The three chatted together very pleasantly for
some time, and when Miss Ida rose to go, she
said that she hoped to have the pleasure of seeing
Mr. Ingham again; but she did not inform him
where she lived, and was apparently rather indifferent
with regard to him.</p>

<p>The next day Mrs. Sanford refurnished the
back room where Mr. Trafton had died, and
Ingham took the room vacated by the Graveses.
On the same day, Mrs. Sanford missed her watch,
and, after searching for it everywhere, she came
to the conclusion that it had been stolen. She
was greatly distressed about it, but she could not
imagine who could have taken it.</p>

<p>A few days after this, Ingham came hurriedly
into the sitting-room looking as if he had been
running hard. He found Mrs. Sanford and Miss
Ida in the kitchen, but when the former came
into the sitting-room, he gave her a significant
look, and said that he had "made a raise." Mrs.
Sanford was highly pleased, but she had no time
to make inquiries, as Miss Ida came in from the
kitchen a moment later. They took supper
together, and had a very gay time, as both Ingham
and Mrs. Sanford were quite excited over the
former's adventure. After Miss Ida had gone
home, Ingham gave Mrs. Sanford ten dollars, and
told her that he and another man had followed a
stranger into the "Burnt District" just at dusk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
and while the other man choked the stranger,
Ingham had "gone through" his pockets. Owing
to the fact that there were very few persons and
no gas-lamps in their vicinity, they had not been
observed in their work of robbery until they let
the man go, when his shouts had attracted attention.
He said that some men had chased them,
and that he had escaped by running into a lumber-yard,
where he had hidden the greater part of
the plunder. He said that he had obtained a roll
of bills, but that he could not tell how much
money there was in all, as he had not had time
to count it. He said that he did not expect to
get much out of it, as he would be obliged to
divide with his partner. The day following, Ingham,
on his return to the house in the evening,
found Mrs. Sanford standing in her room fixing
her hair, while a man stood beside her with his
arm around her waist. The door of her room
was open, so that Ingham could not help seeing
them, and he did not stop, but went straight to
his own room. Mrs. Sanford soon afterward
came to his door and told him that the man he
had seen was Mr. Taylor G. Pratt, the real estate
agent, who occupied the back parlor; that he
was one of her best friends, and that he wanted
to marry her. He had been away for the holidays,
and had only just returned. She had told
him that Ingham was her brother from Detroit,
and that he was going to remain with her for
some time. Ingham was then introduced to Mr
Pratt, and they talked with each other until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
supper-time. Pratt was a middle-aged man, with
a mean-looking face and suspicious manner.
They went to a restaurant for supper, and the
gentlemen paid the bill equally. Pratt seemed
to expect Mrs. Sanford to pay her share, and this
made her angry, though she said nothing about
the matter at the time. When alone with Ingham,
however, she said that Pratt was a miserly
cub, with no generosity whatever. She borrowed
five dollars from him, nevertheless, and then
invented a story about having lost the money to
escape paying it back.</p>

<p>The next evening, when Ingham returned to
his lodgings, he found Mrs. Sanford in a sad
plight; one eye was wholly closed and discolored,
while her whole face was bruised and inflamed
to such an extent as to make her an unpleasant
object to look at. Charlie Stokes, the
policeman, was sitting by the stove, and Mrs.
Sanford, with her head done up in wet towels,
was moaning on the sofa. She explained that
Mrs. Graves had been there, and had seized her
by the throat, beaten, scratched, and kicked her
until she was perfectly helpless from her injuries.
Charlie, the policeman, was trying to
condole with her, but he was evidently out of
favor, for she finally told him to go out and not
bother her any longer.</p>

<p>Ingham told her that she certainly ought to
have Mrs. Graves arrested and punished severely,
and he petted her so nicely that she said
he was her best friend, and that she would do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
anything for him. He prepared a dressing for
her black eye, and got some supper for her, telling
her that on Monday&mdash;that day being Saturday&mdash;she
ought to get out a warrant for the arrest
of Mrs. Graves.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you hit her with the poker?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"I did pick it up," she replied, "but I was
afraid to hit her for fear I should kill her."</p>

<p>"Well, it would have served her just right,
for she had no business to attack you first."</p>

<p>"I know that; but if I had killed her, just
think how awful it would be! Why, her ghost
would haunt me forever after. I don't want to
be haunted. I'm afraid now to go into the room
where Trafton died, and I wouldn't go in there
alone after dark for fifty dollars."</p>

<p>Ingham comforted her all he could, but finally
he said that he must go out for a time, and he
did not return until about ten o'clock. He then
went upstairs quietly, and went to bed. Two or
three hours later, a heavy, groaning sound was
heard in the house. It was difficult to tell exactly
whence it came, but Ingham heard Mrs.
Sanford spring up and open her door. He did the
same, and saw her listening at the half-open door.
The groans were not exactly like those of a person
in distress, but they resembled the efforts of some
stage ghost in a blood-and-thunder drama. Suddenly
Mrs. Sanford stepped out, with her revolver
in her hand, and began to walk toward the hall.
He instantly overtook her and asked her, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
whisper, what she was going to do. She made a
significant motion with her revolver, and again
stopped to listen. He then took the pistol away
from her, saying that the noise was probably due
to some drunken man who had got into the hall.
He told her to go back to bed, and he would investigate.
Accordingly, he went into the hall,
and soon Mrs. Sanford heard him dragging a
maudlin drunken fellow downstairs. This affair
had been arranged by me, in the hope of frightening
Mrs. Sanford into making some kind of a
confession, but she was not so easily alarmed as I
had hoped. The door had been left open by
Ingham on his return to the house, and another
detective had been sent to the top of the stairs to
make the groans. From the determined way in
which she walked out, with her pistol in readiness,
it was evident that she would not have hesitated
to shoot the unfortunate ghost on sight.</p>

<p>The next day Ingham showed her a fine gold
watch, which he said he had snatched out of a
man's pocket in a crowd. She wanted him to
steal one for her, and he promised to do so, if
possible, though it was more difficult to get a
lady's watch. She then advised him to be careful
to see that there was no private mark on the
watch, lest he should be detected thereby. Then
she asked whether the numbers on government
bonds were all different. He said that there were
different series, which were exactly alike except
the letter, and he tried to explain the matter to
her, but she could not understand it. She also<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
wanted to know whether the bonds could be sold
in a foreign country, and he told her yes; that
that was the best way to sell them, if there was
anything wrong about them. After some further
conversation, she said she thought of going
to Canada soon, and perhaps she would like him
to take charge of her rooms while she was away.</p>




<p class="center">CHAPTER III.
</p>

Stranger.&mdash;A "funny" Game of Cards.&mdash;The

<p>It has already been observed by the reader
that, while Ingham had learned nothing
new about the fate of poor Trafton, he had obtained
a very excellent understanding of Mrs.
Sanford's character. Her most prominent characteristic
was the love of money, and this passion
seemed to overpower all others. Her language
and manners at times showed that she had once
been a member of good society, while her reading
and declamations from Shakespeare and other
poets gave evidence of great natural talents.
Combined with her greed for money was a strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
element of sensuality, and though she usually
granted her favors only where she expected a
large pecuniary reward, still, at times, she was
apparently as prodigal in that regard as if she
had no care whatever for money.</p>

<p>Her mind was naturally powerful, and I had
little hope of breaking down her will; she would
evidently show fight to the last, and all that I
could hope would be to learn enough secretly to
insure her conviction without her confession.
She was as shrewd as if all her life had been
passed in evading the toils of the law; even in
her sleep, or when pretending to sleep, she would
talk with great freedom; but, as she never gave
any intelligence of importance on such occasions,
I put little faith in the soundness of her sleep.
In her readiness to assist Ingham to hide his
plunder, I saw the dangerous side of this woman's
nature strongly revealed. If she were so willing
to act as an accomplice in one crime, why not in
another? As she had been so successful in her
encounter with Trafton, might she not be glad to
carry out the same scheme again? At least, there
would be no harm in putting an opportunity before
her, and her actions in one case might give
some clue to those by which she had succeeded
in the former affair.</p>

<p>"Yes, that will be a good plan," I soliloquized;
"I will send a young fellow there with a large
sum of money, and he will get drunk. Then, if
she tries to rob him, I shall be certain that she
did the same with young Trafton."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span></p>

<p>I therefore arranged that Ingham should pretend
that he had made the acquaintance of a
stranger from the East, who had a large sum of
money; he was to tell Mrs. Sanford that he would
bring the stranger to her rooms to spend the
evening; the stranger would be rather drunk
when he arrived there, and they would give him
more liquor, until he should be quite drunk; if
she should then try to rob him, he would get
away as well as possible, and Ingham would go
after him. In a little while, Ingham would return
and show her a package of bonds, stolen
from the stranger, and tell her that he had
knocked the man down with a brick, before robbing
him. The next morning a notice would appear
in the papers to the effect that a stranger
had been found in the burnt district, lying on the
ground in an insensible condition, having been
knocked down and robbed.</p>

<p>Ingham was instructed as to his part in the affair,
and next day he told Mrs. Sanford that there
was a young fellow down town whose acquaintance
he had made, who had a large amount of
money with him. Ingham said that the man's
name was Adamson, and that he was a gambler in
good luck. He wanted to bring Adamson to the
house that evening, and she was very anxious
that he should come.</p>

<p>I intrusted the stranger's part to my son, Robert
A. Pinkerton, who assumed the name of
Adamson for the occasion.</p>

<p>Accordingly, the two detectives met at my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
office, and Adamson was given five hundred dollars
in fifty dollar bonds. They then went to
Mrs. Sanford's house, and, on arriving there,
Mr. Adamson was quite unsteady on his legs.
Mrs. Sanford was nicely dressed to receive the
stranger, and she made herself very agreeable to
him, in spite of his apparent drunkenness. They
played cards together for a time, and then Adamson
proposed to play euchre with Ingham seven
points for five dollars a game. While they were
playing, Adamson became quite reckless, and he
threw down his cards with such a look of
drunken gravity as to be quite amusing. He lost
almost every game, and, at length, he wanted to
go out for a drink. Mrs. Sanford told him to go
on with his game, and she would get what he
wished.</p>

<p>"What do you want to drink?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Anything excep' warrer," he replied.</p>

<p>"What do you know about water?" asked Ingham;
"I don't believe you can tell how it looks."</p>

<p>"Tha's a lie. I know how to tell warrer's
well's you. I (hic) can allus tell warrer&mdash;it looks
jus' like gin. Get us some gin."</p>

<p>While Mrs. Sanford was gone, Ingham and
Adamson arranged that the latter should pretend
to have lost all his money to the former, and
that he should insist upon playing one game for
fifty dollars. This he was to lose, and he was to
become angry and go away. Adamson then gave
Ingham about fifty dollars to show as his winnings,
and presently Mrs. Sanford came in. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a><br /><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>had been introduced to Adamson under the assumed
name of Mrs. Robertson, and he therefore
addressed her by that name.</p>

<p>[Illustration: "<i>I'll play you a (hic) game f'r fiffy doll's!</i>"]</p>

<p>"Mrs. Rob'son, 'f you'd come sooner (hic),
you'd ha' seen th' funniest game 't ever was
played. Never 'ad such bad luck 'n m' life, an'
now I've los' all m' money. Gimme big (hic)
drink of gin."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sanford poured him a glass half full, and
also poured a little into two other glasses. When
she turned her head, Ingham emptied the contents
of his glass into the coal-scuttle, exchanged
glasses with Adamson, and emptied his drink into
the same place. When they stood up to drink,
Mrs. Sanford was the only one who really did so,
the two men merely going through the motions,
with great apparent satisfaction. Adamson then
became more and more excited.</p>

<p>"Tell you, Miss'r Hang'em, or whatever y'r
name is, I'll play you a (hic) game f'r fiffy dolls;
can beat you 't euchre any day th' week. Wha'
you say? Wan' to play?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't want to play for so much, but I'll
play you for twenty-five dollars."</p>

<p>"Fiffy or nothin'. Come, now; 'f you're 'fraid
to play, say so. I c'n play like a steam-whissle,
I can."</p>

<p>"I'll play you for twenty-five," replied Ingham,
irresolutely.</p>

<p>"No, sir; I won't (hic) play'ny more small
games. You've won more'n fiffy doll'rs fr'm me
now, 'n I wan' m' revenge. You goin' ter gimme
a (hic) chance t'win it back?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right," said Ingham; "I'll play you just
one game for fifty dollars, and then we'll stop, no
matter who wins. Just wait a minute, until I
go to my room for a handkerchief."</p>

<p>While he was gone, Adamson pulled out a
package of ten United States bonds, of the denomination
of fifty dollars each, and said that he
would put up one of them against Ingham's fifty
dollars, and that he should send the rest to his
mother. When Ingham returned, he counted
out fifty dollars, and Adamson laid down one of
his bonds.</p>

<p>"What's that?" asked Ingham. "Is that
worth fifty dollars?" and picking it up, he examined
it carefully.</p>

<p>"Yes'r; tha's worth more'n fiffy doll'rs; tha's
worth fiffy doll'rs in gold."</p>

<p>"Will you guarantee that it is good and all
right?" asked Ingham.</p>

<p>"Course I will; didn't you ever see a (hic)
bond b'fore?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I know that's all right," said Mrs. Sanford,
who was beginning to show the effect of
the gin very strongly; "I've had bon's like that,
too. Th' young man who died here had eighteen
thousan' bonds like this."</p>

<p>"Well, all right," said Ingham; "let us cut
for deal."</p>

<p>As the game progressed, Mrs. Sanford felt the
strength of the gin more and more, and she soon
became quite sick. Ingham got her some warm
water, and she went into her own room to vomit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
She soon returned, feeling much better, and the
game went on, Ingham winning by one point.
Adamson then became very angry, and said he
was going out; and, although the others begged
him to stay, he put on his overcoat and insisted
on going away. Ingham finally said that he
didn't care whether Adamson went or stayed, and,
so saying, he walked off to his own room. Mrs.
Sanford used every argument to induce Adamson
to stay all night, but, with a drunken man's obstinacy,
he refused to remain any longer. He walked
downstairs, with Mrs. Sanford clinging to him
and coaxing him all the way, until they reached
the lower landing, when she put her back against
the door and refused to let him out. They then
had a violent struggle, in the course of which she
tore open his coat and vest in the endeavor to get
at the bonds in his breast pocket. Finally, he
was obliged to use all his force to get away, as
she was like a tigress in her anger, and was evidently
determined to rob him. Indeed, had he
not been an active, muscular young man, she
would, undoubtedly, have finished him then and
there; as it was, he barely succeeded in making
his escape, by forcing her back upon the stairs,
and then springing out of the door before she
could seize him again.</p>

<p>Meantime, Ingham was a silent spectator of
this scene from the top of the stairs, where he
stood holding the lamp. As soon as Adamson was
out, Ingham rushed down and told Mrs. Sanford
that he intended to have those bonds anyhow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
He told her to sit up for him, and then ran out
after Adamson. In less than an hour, he returned
and saw Mrs. Sanford watching for him
from a front window. When he went upstairs,
she was still somewhat under the influence of the
liquor she had drank, but she asked him where
he had been.</p>

<p>"That's all right," he replied, flipping over the
ends of the package of bonds; "I guess I've
made a good enough haul this time."</p>

<p>"Oh! you are a splendid fellow," she said,
leaning on his shoulder. "I didn't think you
would dare to do it."</p>

<p>"I dare to do anything where there is any
money to be made. You won't go back on me,
will you?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" she asked.</p>

<p>"I mean, that you won't give me away to the
police?" he asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>"Why, of course I won't," she replied. "I
never yet went back on any one who did the fair
thing by me; and I know you will do that, won't
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh! certainly I will; I will make you a nice
present to-morrow."</p>

<p>"I don't want a present to-morrow," she said,
sullenly; "I want my share now."</p>

<p>"But I shall have to cash these bonds first," he
said. "They would be of no use to you in their
present shape."</p>

<p>"I can get them cashed as well as you can,"
she replied. "Come, hand over; I don't want
half, but I want my share now."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is your hurry?" he demanded. "Can't
you wait until to-morrow?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't; I want my share, and if you are
going to be mean, I will be mean too. You can't
keep those bonds unless I say so, and if I choose
to report you, I can have them all taken from
you, besides sending you to Joliet."</p>

<p>"Oh! if that's the way you talk," replied Ingham,
"I shall know what to do. If you can't
trust me until to-morrow, I can't trust you at all.
You can't scare me by threats, and if you want
to get any of this money, you must deal fairly
with me; I'm not afraid of being arrested."</p>

<p>"All right, then," she answered, with a wicked
look in her eye; "we'll see whether you will
'come down' or not. If you want to keep it
all, I shall take care that you don't keep any of
it. I'm going to the police station at once."</p>

<p>She was, evidently, just ugly enough to do as
she said; and, as Ingham had the bonds in his
possession, he did not fancy the idea of letting
her go for the officers just then; so he replied:</p>

<p>"You can go right along, if you want to, but,
in that case, I shall go somewhere else."</p>

<p>He then quickly brought his hat and overcoat
into the sitting-room; and, seeing that she was
still making preparations to go out, he took a
hurried departure, taking a room at a small hotel
for the night.</p>

<p>In the Chicago <i>Tribune</i> of January 14, 1872,
the following item appeared:</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span></p>

<span style="margin-left: 9em;">"<span class="smcap">Highway Robbery</span>.</span><br />

<blockquote><p>"At about twelve o'clock last night, an officer
of Pinkerton's Preventive Police stumbled over
the body of a man near the corner of State and
Washington streets. Stooping down, he discovered
that the man was half drunk, half insensible,
bruised and bleeding. On being restored to
his senses, he gave his name as Robert Adamson,
stating that he had come from Troy, New York,
having with him several hundred dollars in currency
and bonds. The time between drinks was
very short yesterday afternoon, and he has no
clear idea of what happened after dark, up to the
time the officer found him minus his money and
valuables. He remembers drinking frequently
with a stranger, who made himself very agreeable,
but cannot state the time when they parted
company. He describes the stranger as a tall
slender man, with black side-whiskers, giving a
sufficiently minute description of him to afford
the police a valuable clue, and it is likely that the
highwayman will soon be overhauled."</p></blockquote>

<p>About noon of the day that the above was published,
Ingham went to call upon Mrs. Sanford,
and she received him very coolly.</p>

<p>"How do you feel this morning?" he asked.
"Does your head ache?"</p>

<p>"No, I feel all right," she replied. "Have
you seen that fellow that was here last night?"</p>

<p>"No, I have not seen him," he replied. "Why
do you ask? Has he been here looking for me?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, he came here this morning, and asked
me all kinds of questions about you; and now, if
you are arrested, it will be your own fault. I
would have shielded you, if you had done the
fair thing by me; but now you must look out for
yourself."</p>

<p>"You are very unreasonable, Mrs. Sanford,"
he replied; "it would have been very dangerous
to have left any of those bonds with you, for if
the man had brought the police here, they would
have searched the house, and would have found
the bonds. Then you would have been arrested,
and you would have been obliged to tell where
you got the bonds. Now, as soon as I get the
bonds cashed, I will treat you handsomely, but I
do not intend to run any risks."</p>

<p>"There would have been no danger of their
finding the bonds, if you had left them with me;
and, even if they had found them, I never would
have told where I got them. You might have
been fair enough to give me one hundred dollars
at least."</p>

<p>"He did not have any money besides what I
won from him, except the bonds; and, as I said
before, I did not dare to leave those in the
house."</p>

<p>"I am sorry I ever let you into my house,"
she said, presently. "I thought a great deal of
you, and I expected to assist you when I received
my money; but now I have lost confidence in
you. I suppose, if you got a chance at my
money, you would take that too. I begin to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
think I know where my watch went; the detective
wanted to search you for it two or three
times, but I wouldn't let him, and this is the way
you reward my confidence."</p>

<p>"Mrs. Sanford, you are talking wild," he
answered, angrily. "I have always treated you
well, and when I made a raise the other day, I
gave you a part of it. I intended to do the same
this time, but you acted so suspiciously that I
thought best to wait awhile. Now, as soon as I
get these bonds cashed, I will give you some
more money, but not till then."</p>

<p>"You can keep your old money," she retorted;
"I don't want any of it. You think you were
very smart, yesterday, but you don't know what
danger you are in. I could have you arrested
this very day if I chose."</p>

<p>"I know you could; but what good would it
do you? I should be punished, to be sure, but
you would not get a cent; while, if you keep
quiet, I will make you a fine present."</p>

<p>"I don't want your present, nor you either,"
she replied. "I don't want you in my house any
longer." Then, as Ingham started toward his
room, she said: "Keep out of there; you can't go
into that room, for I've let it to a young couple,
who are in there now."</p>

<p>"All right, then," replied Ingham; "I will call
again to-morrow."</p>

<p>"You needn't take things so mighty cool," she
replied, perfectly white with anger. "You may
find yourself in jail before you know it."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know it," he answered, carelessly; "but it's
my nature to take things cool, and so, if you
want to put me in jail, you can; but you can't
scare me a bit, and you may as well understand
it first as last."</p>

<p>The following morning, I received from Mr.
Trafton, who was then in Philadelphia, the numbers
of the bonds which were missing. They
were five-twenty bonds of the issue of 1865, numbers
57,109 and 87,656, series A, and number
37,515, series B. Information of the robbery had
been sent to the Treasury Department at Washington,
and to all the sub-treasurers in the United
States, in order that, in case any of the interest
coupons should be presented for payment, they
might be traced back, possibly, to the hands of
the thief.</p>

<p>In <i>The Tribune</i> of Monday appeared the following
item:</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 10.5em;">"BEATEN AND ROBBED.</span><br />
</p>

<blockquote><p>"A MAN TAKES A WALK WITH A COMPARATIVE
STRANGER, AND IS KNOCKED DOWN AND ROBBED
OF NEARLY $1,000 IN GREENBACKS.</p>

<p>"Mention was made in yesterday's <span class="smcap">Tribune</span> of
the finding of a man, named Robert Adamson,
on the corner of State and Washington streets,
he having been beaten and robbed of several hundred
dollars in greenbacks. The police were looking
for him yesterday, but failed to find him. It
was ascertained that he had been boarding at No.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
92 West Madison street, and that, on Saturday
night, he indulged in several games of euchre
with a man who also boarded at the place. While
the game was in progress, and Adamson was under
the influence of liquor, he displayed an express
company's envelope full of money. At the
conclusion of the game, the two men went out to
'take a walk.' Yesterday morning, Adamson's
companion returned to the house, and, it is said,
offered the landlady $500 if she would say nothing
about his having played cards with Adamson.
She refused, and would not allow the fellow to
take his trunk away, which he wanted to do very
badly. The landlady sent her little daughter to
police headquarters for an officer, and one was
sent over to arrest the man; but he had left previous
to the officer's arrival. It is not known
how much money Adamson had, but it must
have been in the neighborhood of $1,000, or the
man who took it would not have made such a
munificent offer to have the fact of the theft
kept secret."</p></blockquote>

<p>In accordance with my instructions, Ingham
went to Mrs. Sanford's house about noon on
Monday. He told her that he had read in the
paper that she had reported him to the police as
being the assailant of Robert Adamson. She denied
ever having done so, and offered to swear
that she had never betrayed him. He replied
that he felt sure there must be a mistake, as he
could not believe it possible that she would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>tray
him. He felt perfect confidence in her, and
had no fears that she would try to have him arrested.</p>

<p>"Besides," he continued, "I don't care now
whether they arrest me or not. I'm not afraid
of being held, for I am generally shrewd enough
to cover my tracks pretty thoroughly, if I have a
start of two or three days."</p>

<p>"You can't prove that you didn't rob that
man," she replied.</p>

<p>"I don't need to; all the proof must come from
the other side, and they haven't any witnesses
who can swear that I did the robbery."</p>

<p>"I could prove it, if I choose to go against
you," she said.</p>

<p>"No, you couldn't," he replied. "You didn't
see me; and, while your testimony would, perhaps,
be circumstantial evidence, your oath
would be no better than mine, as you have no
one to swear to the same thing."</p>

<p>"Oh! I have great credit up at the station,"
she said, in a boasting manner. "They recollect
the finding of eighteen thousand dollars under
the pillow of the young man who died here, and
they have all confidence in me, for they know I
might have easily stolen all he had. But I think
it is best never to do anything wrong, and then
there is no fear of getting into trouble."</p>

<p>"That's all right, if you can do it," he replied;
"but I must have a living, and if I can't get it
one way, I will another."</p>

<p>Just then some one knocked at the door, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
presently Charlie Stokes, the policeman, walked
in. They talked together a few minutes, and
then Stokes said:</p>

<p>"Step this way a moment, Mr. Ingham, I wish
to speak to you alone."</p>

<p>They walked to the head of the stairs, and Ingham
then asked what he wished to talk about.</p>

<p>"Well, there seems to be some kind of a misunderstanding
at the police station," said Stokes,
keeping his eyes on the ground, "and they have
sent me to ask you to walk around to the office."</p>

<p>"A misunderstanding about what?" asked
Ingham. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Well, you know all about it," continued
Stokes, in the same mysterious way.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon; I don't know what you
have reference to; please explain."</p>

<p>"Oh! you know well enough. You are
wanted on account of that man you robbed last
Saturday night."</p>

<p>"I did not rob any man Saturday night, and I
am surprised that you should make such a
charge against me, knowing me as well as you
do," said Ingham, in an injured tone.</p>

<p>"I have nothing to do with it," replied Stokes.
"I am simply obeying the captain's order, and I
have no personal feeling against you whatever;
but I have been sent to take you down to the
station, and I must obey orders."</p>

<p>"Then you arrest me?" inquired Ingham.</p>

<p>"Well, you must go to the station with me to
see the captain."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not unless you arrest me," replied Ingham.
"I want to know whether I am to consider myself
under arrest."</p>

<p>"Yes, you can consider yourself arrested, if
you want to," replied Stokes, who did not seem
to like to take the responsibility of making the
arrest under the circumstances.</p>

<p>"I don't want to, and I shan't, unless you say
so," persisted Ingham.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I <i>do</i> say so, and we will go now.
We can walk along together like two friends,
however, and no one need know that you are my
prisoner."</p>

<p>"I don't care who knows it," said Ingham;
"but I think there is something strange in the
way of arresting me."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope you will come out all right,"
Stokes replied, adding significantly, "and perhaps
you will, if certain folks don't appear
against you."</p>

<p>"I'm not afraid," replied Ingham; "there is
no one who can say anything against me."</p>

<p>On arriving at the station, the same consideration
was shown to him, and the station-keeper
asked him to make himself comfortable in the
main sitting-room.</p>

<p>"Am I under arrest?" he asked again.</p>

<p>"No, not exactly; you can take it easy for a
time, and you will have an examination soon."</p>

<p>"If I am not under arrest," Ingham replied,
"I shall not stay here."</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked the station-keeper.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<p>"Because I have no business here unless I am
a prisoner," was Ingham's reply.</p>

<p>"We can lock you up in a cell, if we want to,"
said the station-keeper; "but we thought you
would prefer to be comfortable up here."</p>

<p>"Then I <i>am</i> a prisoner?" again inquired Ingham,
who seemed anxious to have his status
satisfactorily explained.</p>

<p>"Yes, confound it; if you are determined to
have it so, you are."</p>

<p>About five o'clock the sergeant of police came
in, and asked Ingham his name.</p>

<p>"Ingham," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Jack Ingham?"</p>

<p>"No; John Ingham."</p>

<p>"What is your business?" asked the sergeant.</p>

<p>"I'm not employed at all, just now."</p>

<p>"Have you ever had any work to do in this
city?" again queried the sergeant.</p>

<p>"No; not yet."</p>

<p>"Who was that man you were playing cards
with the other night?"</p>

<p>"What night?" asked Ingham.</p>

<p>"Well, Saturday night."</p>

<p>"Whereabouts?"</p>

<p>"At your boarding place."</p>

<p>"Oh! I play cards with a great many fellows,"
Ingham replied. "I don't know which one you
mean."</p>

<p>"Well, we know who he was," said the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Then what are you asking me for?" said
Ingham. "Am I under arrest?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span></p>

<p>"I guess you will have to stay here awhile,"
was the sergeant's reply.</p>

<p>Presently a number of persons came into the
room, and Ingham thought he saw among them
one of the bindery girls who had formerly lodged
with Mrs. Sanford. She looked at him very hard,
and then went out into the hall, where he could
hear her talking with the station-keeper and
Stokes. He also heard the sergeant call a policeman
and give him some instructions, in which
Ingham caught the words, "Pinkerton's office."
The man then put on his coat and went out.
Presently the sergeant approached him again,
and, looking at him significantly, said:</p>

<p>"Now we know all about your playing cards
with that man, and afterward robbing him."</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," Ingham replied;
"I don't know what man you are talking
about."</p>

<p>"Didn't you see that piece in the paper yesterday?"
asked the sergeant.</p>

<p>"I saw a number of pieces in the paper yesterday,
but I can't tell which one you are referring
to."</p>

<p>The sergeant then showed him the item headed
"Highway Robbery," and said:</p>

<p>"Now, we can prove that you came back to
your landlady with a large package of money,
and offered her five hundred dollars to keep quiet
about the fact of your having played cards with
this young fellow, and then having followed him
out."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, if you can prove that, you had better
do it," said Ingham; then, changing his tone, and
looking straight in the sergeant's face, he added:
"Now, look here, sergeant, if you have any
charges against me, just state them."</p>

<p>The sergeant muttered something about locking
him up, and started to go out.</p>

<p>"If you lock me up," replied Ingham, coolly,
"I hope you are prepared to take the consequences."</p>

<p>"Who the devil are you, anyhow?" asked the
sergeant.</p>

<p>"No relation of yours, I assure you," was the
reply, and the sergeant went away.</p>

<p>At this time, a tall, dignified man came in and
asked the station-keeper a question. The policeman
replied that there was no such man there.</p>

<p>"I know better than that," said the stranger,
"and I must see him."</p>

<p>The station-keeper declared positively that they
had no such man, and the stranger then went upstairs.
In a few minutes the sergeant came in
and told Ingham to follow him. As they were
going upstairs, they met the tall stranger coming
down. Ingham felt confident that this man was
looking for him, and, in passing, he pinched the
stranger's leg. The pinch was returned, and the
tall man stopped; but Ingham and the sergeant
went up to the captain's room. After asking
Ingham his name, the captain said:</p>

<p>"Where were you last Saturday night?"</p>

<p>"That is none of your business," said Ingham.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, now, you needn't put on any airs,"
said the captain; "I want to know all about
this."</p>

<p>"Captain," Ingham replied, "if you have any
charges against me, I should like to hear them.
I don't put on any airs, but I want to know what
I am under arrest for."</p>

<p>Turning to the sergeant, the captain said:</p>

<p>"How long would it take you to bring that
man on here, sergeant?"</p>

<p>"Three or four days, at least," was the answer.</p>

<p>Just then the tall stranger entered, and the
captain took him into a private room, where they
remained some time. When they came out, the
sergeant joined the captain for a few minutes,
while the tall gentleman introduced himself to
Ingham as Judge B&mdash;&mdash;, and said that the captain
would let him go. This proved true, for the
captain very soon came out, and told Ingham
that he was at liberty.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span></p>




<p class="center">CHAPTER IV.
</p>

from her, and another takes his Place.&mdash;Mrs. Sanford's
mind frequently burdened with the Subject of

<p>Ingham did not return to Mrs. Sanford's until
late in the evening of the day of his arrest.
On arriving there, he was admitted by Charlie
Stokes, the policeman, who seemed very much
surprised to see him. Mrs. Sanford was also
quite astonished, and turned very pale on seeing
him. However, they soon began talking in a very
friendly way, expressing their regret at his arrest
and their pleasure at his release. Charlie did
not remain long, and after he was gone Mrs. Sanford
made all kinds of inquiries as to the manner
of his escape.</p>

<p>"Why, Mrs. Sanford," he replied, "I told you
they couldn't hold me. There was absolutely no
evidence against me, and they were afraid to
even lock me up. I have been ten years in this
business, in New Orleans and elsewhere, and I
have never been caught yet. The only thing
which puzzles me, is to account for my being arrested
at all!"</p>

<p>"You don't suspect that I had any hand in it,
I hope?" asked Mrs. Sanford.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no indeed! I trust you perfectly; but I
think that one of those bindery girls may have
seen me with Adamson on the street. One of
them came into the station while I was there,
and looked at me very hard, as if trying to identify
me. Still, I don't see how she could have suspected
anything, unless some one put her up to it."</p>

<p>"Perhaps some bartender may have seen you
drinking with him during the afternoon," she
suggested, "and he may have described you to
the police."</p>

<p>"Well, I should like to know who it was," he
said, savagely, "for I would shoot him like a
dog."</p>

<p>As Mrs. Sanford had rented Ingham's room,
there was no place for him to stay, and he went
away about midnight, telling her that he would
return next day. He did not go there, however,
until after dark, as he felt confident that the police
would try to "shadow" him. He found Mrs.
Sanford quite uneasy about him, as she thought
he had been arrested again. He invited her to
go to the theatre, and, on their way home, they
stopped at a restaurant to get a late supper. As
there were no accommodations for him, he was
obliged to go to a hotel for the night, but Mrs.
Sanford promised to have a bed put into the unfurnished
room for him the next day. The next
afternoon he called again, and Mrs. Sanford said
that Charlie had been there, and had told her all
about their visit to the theatre the night before.
She said that he knew exactly where they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
been, what they had had for supper, and what
they had paid. Ingham was thus made aware
that he was being watched, and his position,
therefore, became very embarrassing.</p>

<p>"Oh! by the way," she exclaimed, suddenly,
"did I tell you that I got back my watch?"</p>

<p>"No; how did you recover it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, that man Graves had it, and I had to
pay one hundred dollars to get it back."</p>

<p>"That was a great shame," said Ingham, sympathetically,
as if he fully believed her.</p>

<p>"Yes, I got my watch and several other trinkets,
which I had all together in one box. See,
here they are," she said, producing a box.</p>

<p>Ingham looked at them with great interest,
and, among the old sleeve-buttons, odd earrings,
and other broken pieces of jewelry, he saw two
gold shirt studs, one diamond-shaped, and the
other star-shaped. This was a small matter, but
it was one of the connecting links, nevertheless,
in the chain of evidence against her; for, from
the description, I felt sure that these were young
Trafton's missing studs.</p>

<p>Ingham spent the evening with her, and she
was very friendly indeed, seeming anxious to remove
any suspicion he might have that she was
responsible for his arrest. She had made no arrangements
for him to sleep there, however, and
so he went to a small hotel for the night. When
he reported at my office the following day, I gave
him four hundred dollars in money, and told him
to show it to Mrs. Sanford as the proceeds of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
sale of the stolen bonds. Accordingly, when he
went there in the afternoon, he counted over a
large pile of bills before her astonished eyes, and
asked her if he didn't know how to make things
pay well.</p>

<p>"Why, where did you get all that money?"
she asked.</p>

<p>"I sold those bonds which I showed you the
other night," he replied. "I tell you, it isn't
every man who knows how to dispose of property
when it falls into his hands."</p>

<p>"Now you will be flush for a long time, won't
you?" she said, in her most amiable manner.
"What are you going to do with all that?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I shall have to divide with my partner
first," he replied.</p>

<p>"Did you have a partner in this affair?" she
asked. "You did not tell me about him."</p>

<p>"Oh! yes; I had the same partner as in the
other case," Ingham replied. "He held Adamson,
and I struck him with a brick. However,
here is a present before I go, May," he continued,
tossing two ten-dollar notes into her lap.
"I will give you some more in a day or two."</p>

<p>Mrs. Sanford was very much gratified, and
said that she cared more for him than for any
one else, and he could depend upon her for anything.
Ingham then left her, and came to my
office to return the money. In the evening he
took Mrs. Sanford and Miss Ida Musgrove to the
theatre, and the latter, evidently having heard
of his improved fortunes, treated him with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
cordiality. They returned to the rooms of Miss
Ida after the theatre was out, and Mrs. Sanford
gave some fine imitations of different actors and
actresses, in a way which showed great powers of
mimicry, as well as considerable dramatic force.
It was very late when Ingham and Mrs. Sanford
got home, and they immediately went to bed.</p>

<p>The next day, Ingham went away as usual,
and stayed until nearly dark. When he saw Mrs.
Sanford, he professed to be in a very sulky mood,
and said that he had been gambling all day.</p>

<p>"At first I won right along, and I was nearly
two thousand dollars ahead at one time; but the
cursed luck changed, and I began to lose every
bet; so that, when I left, I had only ten dollars
in my pocket out of all that money I got for the
bonds."</p>

<p>Ingham could not control his feelings as he
thought of his loss, and he swore and raved like
a crazy man. Mrs. Sanford was very much disappointed,
also, but she did not say much, except
that he ought to have known better than to gamble.
There were two or three new lodgers coming
in and out while he was there, so that he did
not have much time to talk to her, and he went
away early in the evening.</p>

<p>Owing to the arrest of Ingham, and his quarrel
with Mrs. Sanford, I had decided to relieve him
from this operation, and to put another man in
his place. His story about gambling was a part
of my plan; and the next day, when he called
upon her, he was under instructions to announce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
his intended departure from the city. Accordingly,
he did so, giving as a reason the fact that
he had lost all his money, and that the police
were watching him so closely that he was afraid
to attempt another robbery in Chicago. He told
her that he was going to St. Louis, and that he
should come to see her immediately, if he ever
should return.</p>

<p>She appeared very much distressed at the
thought of losing him, and told him that when
she got her money, she would let him have as
much as he wanted. She made him promise to
write to her, and when he went away, she cried
with seemingly genuine sorrow.</p>

<p>Three days later Mrs. Sanford received a visit
from a gentleman who said he wished to rent a
furnished room. Mrs. Sanford seemed to like his
appearance, and she offered him the small back
room at a low rent. Having decided to take it,
he told her that his name was Henry C. Morton,
recently from England.</p>

<p>"Oh! I am so glad you are from the old country,"
said Mrs. Sanford, "as I am from Edinboro'
myself, and my father is Lord Chief Justice of
the courts there. He is very rich, and has treated
me very liberally since I left my husband; why,
only last week, he sent me three thousand dollars."</p>

<p>Just then a Mr. Bruce, the owner of the furniture
store below, came in, looking rather tipsy.
Mrs. Sanford introduced the two men, and Mr.
Bruce said something about being an Irishman.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, what a strange coincidence," said Mr.
Morton. "Here are three persons, each representing
one of the three kingdoms of Great Britain.
If I had some one to send for some ale,
we would drink a toast to Britannia, God bless
her!"</p>

<p>After talking together for some time, Mrs.
Sanford and Mr. Morton went into the sitting-room,
and Mr. Bruce went down to his store.
Then Morton said that he had left his valise at
the Stock Yards, and that he would go for it at
once. On his return, he found two rough-looking
men at the door trying to get in, but the bell
would not ring, and so Morton went away for
half an hour, leaving the men knocking and kicking
on the door. About eight o'clock, he came
back and found the door open. He went upstairs
and entered the sitting-room. Mrs. Sanford
was full of apologies for having locked him
out, but she said that she had had trouble with
one of her boarders, and she had resolved to keep
him out of the house. While they were talking,
the two men whom Morton had seen at the door
came in, and a quarrel immediately sprang up
between Mrs. Sanford and the younger of the
two. In a short time, they both became furiously
angry, and they used the most bitterly opprobrious
language toward each other. Finally,
Mrs. Sanford, who was ironing, rushed at the
young man with a flatiron in her hand, and she
would undoubtedly have seriously injured him if
he had not escaped into his own room at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
head of the stairs. She then laid a heavy poker
on the table beside her, and said that she would
mash his skull if he came near her again. In
a short time, he again reëntered the room,
when, seizing the poker, she rushed at him like
a fury. He succeeded in avoiding her until Morton
and the other man induced her to give up the
poker; and both the strangers then went away,
saying that they should be back at eleven
o'clock.</p>

<p>After their departure, Mrs. Sanford dropped
into a chair and cried for a time, saying that she
never had acted so before in her life, as no one
had ever treated her so shamefully. Then she
became loquacious and confidential, telling Morton
the old story of her father being Lord Chief
Justice of Scotland, and her husband a wealthy
man in Buffalo. She recited the reasons she had
for leaving her husband, and said that her father
first sent her one hundred and fifty dollars after
the separation, but that she thought so small a
sum was an insult, and so she sent it back. She
added that he had promised her three thousand
dollars very soon, and that she expected to receive
it in a week or two. From this subject,
she drifted to the story of young Trafton's death,
which she told with great minuteness. She said
that when she found he was dead, she fainted
away, and did not recover for nearly two hours.</p>

<p>While she was running on in her story, a loud
noise was heard, and she explained to Morton
that Mr. Bruce had been drinking all day, until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
he was afraid to go home, and that now he was
quite drunk in her room. She said that he had
been very kind to her in letting her have furniture
on credit, and so she wanted to make him
comfortable until he was sobered off. During
the evening she recited a number of selections
from Byron, Scott, and Longfellow, and even
gave several parts from Shakespeare's plays with
great force and beauty of elocution. She also
talked a great deal about Jack Ingham, a former
lodger in her rooms, and she seemed to have a
very high opinion of him. She said that he was
obliged to leave town because the police were
after him about something he had done, adding,
that she didn't care for that, however, and she
would never go back on a friend, but would shield
him for anything except murder. It was after
two o'clock in the morning before they retired,
and as she had not fitted up Morton's room properly,
she made a bed for him on the lounge in the
sitting-room. As Mr. Bruce was lying dead-drunk
on her bed, she was obliged to sleep on the
floor of her room.</p>

<p>About four o'clock Morton was awakened by
Mrs. Sanford, who said that she could not sleep
in her room, as Bruce snored so loudly, just as
Stanley Trafton did the night he died.</p>

<p>"Oh! it is horrible to think of," she said, shuddering.
"I shall go crazy if I stay in there any
longer."</p>

<p>She then lay down on the table and covered
herself with a bedspread she had brought from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
her own room. About six o'clock they were
awakened by a loud noise at the outer door, and
Mrs. Sanford said that those drunken loafers had
come back again. She immediately got up, took
a revolver from her room, and went down to the
door, where she told the men to go away, as she
would not admit them at that time of night.
While she was talking Bruce began moving
around, and he found his way into the hall.
Then Morton heard a great crash, as if some one
had fallen downstairs, followed by a call from
Mrs. Sanford, in tragic tones, for him to come and
help her. Morton went out and found that Bruce
had fallen from the top to the foot of the stairs,
and on going down he discovered the unfortunate
representative of the Emerald Isle lying in a
heap against the front door. The two men outside
had evidently been scared away by the noise,
and they did not return until eight o'clock.
Bruce was not hurt, except a cut on his hand,
which Morton bound up, and then quiet reigned
again until after daylight. About nine o'clock
Morton went in to see Bruce, whom he found
sitting up in bed. Bruce said that his money
was gone, and that Mrs. Sanford had drugged
him the night before to enable her to steal it.
Morton called Mrs. Sanford, and asked where
Bruce's money was. She said she had put it
away for safe keeping, and, lifting the mattress,
she took out two pocket-books and a box containing
her watch, trinkets, etc. Having given
Bruce his pocket-book, she went out, and he then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
counted his money. He said he ought to have
eighty-one dollars, but that she had helped herself
to ten dollars; it was not worth while making
a fuss about it, but he said that he knew she
had drugged him.</p>

<p>After awhile, Mr. Graves came in, and had a
private interview with Mrs. Sanford. She seemed
afraid of him, while he acted as if he had some
hold upon her. When they came into the sitting-room,
where Bruce and Morton were talking together,
Mrs. Sanford asked Graves to lend her a
dollar, but he refused.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! I don't want it," she replied. "I only
asked to see whether you'd lend it, as I have
quite enough of my own;" and, so saying, she
took out her pocket-book.</p>

<p>Morton saw her count out nine ten-dollar bills
and nine one-dollar bills. From the fact that she
showed just ninety-nine dollars, it was probable
that she had only recently changed one of the
one-hundred-dollar bills taken from young Trafton.
She then opened another compartment, and
took out two pieces of folded paper, of a creamy
tint, apparently about the size of two sheets of
foolscap. They were folded several times, and
were crammed in pretty tight.</p>

<p>"Do you know what those are?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, I do not," he replied; "what are they?"</p>

<p>She merely laughed, and closed the pocket-book,
whispering that she didn't want Graves
and Bruce to see her money. She said she did
not wish to be left alone with Graves, for fear he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
should rob her; so Morton asked him to go out
and play a game of billiards. Bruce was in a
great state of anxiety, lest his wife should have
come down to the store to see where he had spent
the night, and he remained with Mrs. Sanford.</p>

<p>Morton did not return to Mrs. Sanford's until
late in the evening, and he found her dressing to
go to a ball. She insisted that he should go,
offering to pay all the expenses. He pretended
to be very much hurt at her suggestion, saying
that he never would permit any lady to pay anything
when he took her out. She was dressed
very tastefully, and presented a very stylish appearance,
so that she attracted a good deal of attention
at the ball. Before going, she sent Morton
to a drug store for a drachm of morphine, saying
that she must have it, as she used it constantly.</p>

<p>The next morning, they did not get up until a
late hour, and Mrs. Sanford said that she did not
feel very well. While talking together, they
drifted into a discussion about money. Morton,
like a genuine John Bull, maintaining there was
no safety except in gold, or Bank of England
notes.</p>

<p>"But we don't have either in this country,"
said Mrs. Sanford; "and now, suppose you had a
large sum of money, what would you do with
it?"</p>

<p>"That's just what I would like to know," he replied.
"I expect to receive one hundred pounds
from England very soon, and I don't know where
to keep it."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I shall put my three thousand dollars
into bonds," she said. "They can be registered,
so that no one can use them except the rightful
owner, and the interest is payable in gold."</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about bonds," said
Morton, "especially these American bonds, which
sometimes depreciate very fast."</p>

<p>"Oh! the bonds of the United States are good
anywhere," she replied, "and they will sell for
their face in England or Canada just as well as
here. They are the best securities there are. I
have some now, and I intend to get some more."</p>

<p>While talking, Morton picked up a card which
was in her work-basket, and saw that it was an
advertisement of a gift concert or lottery. She
noticed it, and said that it had been left there by
a man named Druen, who used to come to see
her. She said that he had stolen a five-hundred-dollar
bond from her, however, and he had never
been there since. Soon afterward she went to
sleep again, and did not awake until evening, as
she was very tired from the effects of the ball.
Morton remained in the house all day; and, when
she woke up, he got supper for her. She seemed
very much pleased at his thoughtfulness, and
said that she never had had any one so kind to
her since she left her husband.</p>

<p>"I want you to go to the bank with me some
day," she said, "as I want to draw the interest on
some of my coupons, and then you will see what
good securities American bonds are."</p>

<p>"I shall be very glad to go with you," said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
Morton; "for, if they are really good securities,
I will invest some money in them."</p>

<p>"Oh! there is nothing better," she replied,
"and I will show you mine."</p>

<p>She then took out the pocket-book she had
shown him before, and unfolded one of the
pieces of paper. Morton saw that it was a five-hundred-dollar
bond, of the issue of 1865, payable
in 1885, with about twenty or thirty coupons
attached. He was so surprised and excited at
seeing the bond, that he could hardly tell what to
do, and so he failed to notice the most important
point&mdash;the number. By the time she had opened
the other bond, however, he had his wits a little
more under command, and he was able to remember
that the figures of the number were
five, seven, one, zero, and some other figure; but
he could not recollect positively the order in
which they came.</p>

<p>"You can go to the bank to-morrow and get
the coupons cashed for me, can't you?" she
asked, after putting away the bonds.</p>

<p>"Oh! certainly, if you wish me to do so," he
replied.</p>

<p>Then she laughed, and said:</p>

<p>"You would be arrested if you should take
these bonds to the bank."</p>

<p>"How so?" he asked, apparently in great surprise.
"Why should I be arrested?"</p>

<p>"Because the bonds belong to me, and you
would have to give an account of the way in
which you obtained them."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! well," he replied, "you could give me an
order, and that would make it all right."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so," she said, carelessly.</p>

<p>Her object, evidently, was to make Morton
believe that it would not do for him to attempt
to steal the bonds; for, though she trusted him
to the extent of showing him her money and
valuables, she was eternally suspicious and careful.</p>

<p>Of course, on receiving Morton's report, I felt
quite confident that the two bonds he had seen
were a part of those taken from young Trafton.
Still, I had no positive proof of their identity,
and, in accordance with my invariable custom, I
took no hasty step, being confident that my
detective would soon elicit all the facts. I wrote
to Mr. Richard S. Trafton, however, suggesting
that he have himself appointed administrator of
his son's estate, so that he could begin proceedings
instantly, the moment I was ready.</p>

<p>Several days passed, during which Morton
gained Mrs. Sanford's confidence more and more.
She was anxious one evening that he should rob
Mr. Bruce, who came in half drunk; but Morton
told her that he never worked that way.</p>

<p>"Why, Jack Ingham would have killed a man
to get money out of him," said Mrs. Sanford.
"Jack wasn't afraid to do anything for money."</p>

<p>"Well, that isn't my style," said Morton, contemptuously.
"Do you suppose I am going to
have a scuffle and struggle, ending perhaps in
murder, when I can make ten times as much by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
a little skillful work with my pen? I don't want
the police to be snuffing 'round my heels on account
of highway robbery and such small game;
when <i>I</i> do anything to set them after me, it will
be for a big stake, and even if they catch me,
they will be mighty glad to compromise. Oh!
no; not any little jobs for me; it is only the big
rascals who can work safely."</p>

<p>Morton succeeded in inducing her to leave
Bruce alone, though she had evidently meant to
drug him, for she took a glass of beer, which she
had poured out for him, and threw it into the
sink. They all drank considerable beer, however,
during the evening, and Mrs. Sanford, having
taken also a large dose of morphine, became
nearly insensible. On seeing her condition, Morton
and another lodger thought they had better
put her to bed; but as Bruce was in a drunken
stupor in her room, Morton determined to try the
effect of putting her into the room where young
Trafton had died. No sooner had they laid her
on the bed, however, before she sprang up, gazed
around an instant, and then rushed shrieking
from the room, saying that she dare not lie there,
and that she had seen "him" lying beside her.
She was then placed on the lounge in the sitting-room,
where she became quite hysterical. Morton
sat beside her, and soothed her until she
became quiet, and about midnight she fell asleep.</p>

<p>Morton said to me, on making one of his
reports, that she would often determine to give
up morphine and liquor, and live more respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span>ably.
Then she would become excited from the
craving for the drug, and would take a dose,
which would soothe her, make her amiable, and
give her energy enough to do anything; gradually
she would become wild again, and would be
almost unbearable, while the maddening effect
lasted, especially if she took any liquor to add to
her temper; finally, the influence would pass off,
leaving her weak, despondent, and stupidly affectionate.
I saw that she was not likely to confess
anything to any one, and I therefore decided to
bring the affair to a crisis without delay.</p>

<p>Having discussed my plan with my superintendent,
Mr. F. Warner, I sent for one of
my youngest men, named Thomas Barlow, and
gave him explicit instructions as to the course
which he was to pursue in connection with Mrs.
Sanford.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<p>On the first day of February, therefore, a young
fellow called at Mrs. Sanford's about five o'clock
in the afternoon, and asked if she had any rooms
to rent. She was very civil to him, and offered
him the room at the head of the stairs, for three
dollars a week. While she was showing him the
rooms, she asked him a number of questions
about himself; and as he was a smooth-faced,
innocent-looking young man, he told her all
about his affairs. He said that his name was
Thomas Barlow, from Texas, where his father
was a great cattle-raiser; he had brought several
hundred head of cattle to the city, and had sold
them at a high price; he intended staying in Chicago
for a short time, and then he should go up
the Red River of the North, in the early spring,
to do some fur trading, as he believed there was
a good deal of money to be made up there, by any
one with sufficient capital; he intended to have a
good time in Chicago first, however.</p>

<p>As soon as Mrs. Sanford learned that he had
money with him, she became very affectionate
indeed, telling him that she would make him
more comfortable than he could be anywhere else,
and that she would treat him like a prince. She
introduced Morton as her brother, and said that
they would all go to the theatre together. At
first, Barlow refused, but she insisted so urgently,
that he finally consented to go. He went away
for an hour to get his valise, and when he returned,
Mrs. Sanford was dressed in her most
stylish clothes, as if determined to make the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
possible impression upon him. He was very
good-natured and boyish, apparently believing all
she told him, and laughing at all her attempts to
be funny. After leaving the theatre, she learned
that one of her old acquaintances was to have a
"grand opening" in a new saloon, and she was
obstinately determined to find the place. After
walking about for an hour, she called a hackman,
and offered him five dollars to find this new
saloon, where she was anxious to take a drink,
as she said, "for good luck and old acquaintance'
sake." After driving about until midnight, she
learned that the opening was postponed, and
they then went to a restaurant near her house to
get supper. It was two o'clock before they went
to bed, but before going, Mrs. Sanford learned
that Barlow was to receive his pay for the cattle
in a check for over four thousand dollars. She
talked with him about the risk of carrying money
around on the person, and told him that he ought
to buy bonds, as then they would not be lost even
if they should be stolen. He agreed with her,
and said that he would try to buy some bonds
when he got his check cashed.</p>

<p>The next morning they took breakfast with
Mrs. Sanford, as she seemed anxious to keep
Barlow with her as much as possible. It was
noticeable that she did not, as she had usually
done in all previous instances, tell him anything
about young Trafton, who had died in her house,
"with eighteen thousand dollars in bonds in his
boots." She told Barlow that she had some bonds,
and he would do well to get the same kind.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know much about them," he replied,
"but if <i>you</i> think they are good, I guess they are
good enough for me. What are they like? I
never saw any."</p>

<p>"I will show you mine," said Mrs. Sanford.
"I am going to sell one of them soon, as my
lease is up at the end of the month, and I want
to buy a house."</p>

<p>She then went into her bedroom, closed the door,
and remained several minutes. When she came
out, she had a fat pocket-book in her hand, and
she took from it the two pieces of folded paper
which she had shown to Morton. On opening
them, she spread them out, and both Barlow and
Morton saw the numbers plainly, as they looked
over her shoulder.</p>

<p>"There, these little tickets are coupons," she
explained to Barlow; "and every six months I
can get fifteen dollars in gold by cutting off one
from each bond."</p>

<p>"Did you say you wanted to sell one?" asked
Morton. "If you do, perhaps you might sell it
to Mr. Barlow, as a sample of the kind he wants
to get."</p>

<p>"Yes, that would be a good idea," said Barlow;
"then they can't fool me with any other kind,
when I go to buy."</p>

<p>"Well, I guess I will do it," said Mrs. Sanford;
"at any rate, you can see me about it before you
go to buy yours."</p>

<p>She then put the bonds into the pocket-book
again and went into her bedroom. On her re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span>turn,
Barlow told her that he must go down town
to get paid for his cattle, and he asked Morton to
go with him. Accordingly, the two men went
out about noon, but Mrs. Sanford called Morton
back a moment to tell him to stay with Barlow
all day.</p>

<p>"Don't you lose sight of him for a minute,"
she said; "and bring him back here with all his
money."</p>

<p>They did not return until after four o'clock,
and Barlow told her that he had been obliged to
go to the stockyards to get paid. He then went
to his room for a few minutes, and Mrs. Sanford
asked Morton whether Barlow had his money
with him.</p>

<p>"Yes, they gave him a check for the amount,
but it was too late to get it cashed, and he will
have to wait until to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Couldn't we get it away from him and forge
his name to it?" she asked. "We could get it
cashed the first thing in the morning."</p>

<p>"It would be too risky," he replied, "as they
probably know him at the bank, and we should
be arrested at once. But you can offer to go
with him to the bank in the morning, and he is
so soft that you will not have much trouble in
getting a large sum out of him."</p>

<p>During the evening, Mrs. Sanford was very
affectionate toward Barlow, and she learned all
about him. He told his story in such a way, that
she believed him to be an innocent country boy
from Texas, whose most dangerous experiences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
had hitherto consisted of hairbreath 'scapes from
steer and bull. He showed her a check on the
First National Bank for about four thousand dollars,
and told her that when he got it cashed in
the morning, he would give her a nice present.
It was then agreed that she should go to the bank
with him next day. The evening was spent in
reading aloud and singing, and they all retired
much earlier than usual.</p>

<p>When Morton and Barlow left Mrs. Sanford at
noon, they had, of course, come to my office to
report their discovery of the stolen bonds. There
was now no possibility of a mistake, as they had
seen the two bonds of the series A, numbered
57,109 and 87,656. I therefore instructed Mr.
Warner to obtain a warrant for her arrest, and
a search warrant for her house, both to be served
the next morning before the hour appointed for
going to the bank with Barlow. Everything was
prepared in advance, a trustworthy constable was
obtained to make the arrest, and a telegram was
sent to Mr. R. S. Trafton in Cleveland, asking him
to come to Chicago immediately. A reply was
received the next morning, stating that he had
left by the evening train.</p>

<p>About eleven o'clock on Saturday, February 3,
Mr. Warner and the constable arrived at Mrs.
Sanford's rooms. On knocking at the door of the
sitting-room, they were admitted by Morton, who
asked what they wanted.</p>

<p>"I would like to engage rooms, if there are
any to rent," said Mr. Warner.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span></p>

<p>"I will speak to the landlady," said Morton,
going to the door of her room.</p>

<p>"Tell the gentleman to call again," said Mrs.
Sanford; "I am not dressed, and can't see him."</p>

<p>"I only wish to see her a few minutes," Mr.
Warner replied, addressing Morton in a tone loud
enough to be heard by Mrs. Sanford, whose door
was slightly ajar.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't see the gentleman until this
afternoon," she replied.</p>

<p>"I have some important business, and I must
attend to it now," answered Mr. Warner, putting
his foot in the opening and pushing the door in
with his shoulder; then he continued, addressing
the constable, "This is Mrs. Sanford, and you
can arrest her now."</p>

<p>The constable immediately took charge of her,
and she was allowed to complete her toilet,
though Mr. Warner first searched her dress, before
letting her put it on. He then made a careful
search of the bedroom, during the progress of
which Mrs. Sanford was very noisy and troublesome,
crying, and pretending to go into hysterics
several times. Once, when Mr. Warner was looking
very carefully through her trunk, she said to
him, in very tragic tones:</p>

<p>"By the way you act, one would think you
were looking for a murdered man."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps if we had come a little sooner,
we might have found one," he replied, quickly,
giving her a sharp glance.</p>

<p>As nothing had been said to her or to any one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
else about any charge except that of larceny, this
remark was highly significant; and, on her trial,
it undoubtedly had great weight with the jury.</p>

<p>Mr. Warner soon found the pocket-book containing
the bonds under the mattress of her bed,
and after examining them sufficiently to identify
them, he gave them to the constable. Mrs. Sanford
was then taken to my office, and, as Mr.
Trafton had arrived from Cleveland, we tried to
have an interview with her relative to young
Trafton's death. She was too crafty, however,
and she pretended to go into hysterics whenever
we began to question her.</p>

<p>Meantime, Morton and Barlow had accompanied
her, and Morton offered to get her a lawyer
to advise her. She was very grateful to him, and
said he was her only friend. He soon brought in
a lawyer well versed in defending criminals, and
the whole party then went to the justice's courtroom.
At the close of the examination, she was
held to await the action of the Grand Jury, and,
in default of two thousand dollars bail, she was
sent to the county jail. She told Morton that her
lawyer could not half lie, and that she should not
pay him a cent. She stood up, when the justice's
decision was announced, and made quite a
speech; and the native cunning of the woman
was never more clearly shown than in this plea,
which was undoubtedly invented on the spur of
the moment. She claimed that young Trafton
had given her the bonds to support her child,
whose father he was, and she spoke with so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
vigor and cunning that many persons believed her
statement to be true. Thus, without consultation
or legal advice, she invented in a moment
the strongest possible defense against the charge
of larceny,&mdash;the charge of murder had not then
been brought.</p>

<p>When she was removed to the jail, she gave
Morton the keys to her rooms, telling him to take
charge of everything there, and to find a purchaser
for her furniture. He therefore informed
two young men who were lodging there that Mrs.
Sanford had been arrested, and that they must
find other rooms, as he intended to sell out the
furniture. After they had gone he cleaned up
the house, packed Mrs. Sanford's trunks, and
made everything look as well as possible. While
she was awaiting trial, he visited her every day
and gave her various delicacies to improve the
prison fare. One day he pretended to have
pawned his overcoat for five dollars, in order to
get her some lemons, tea, and sugar. She was
very much touched, and she gave him five dollars
to get back his coat; but this action was
due to a momentary impulse. She had plenty of
money, and was able to get anything she wanted;
but her desire to hold fast to her money was
greater than her wish for good food. Indeed,
she came near jeopardizing her cause by refusing
to pay the lawyer she had engaged, but finally
she gave him a retaining fee of fifty dollars.</p>

<p>She was very anxious to learn who were the
detectives employed in working up the case, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
she said that she believed Barlow had had something
to do with her arrest. Morton agreed with
her, and, as the papers had said that there were
three engaged in the case, he suggested that perhaps
the two men whom she had turned out of
doors were also detectives. She never suspected
either Ingham or Morton for a moment; and
when Ingham called upon her in jail, she was
delighted to see him. She tried to get bail from
the two brothers, named Pratt, who had occupied
one of her rooms, as one of them had been
very intimate with her; but they were afraid of
getting mixed up in her difficulties, and so refused
to help her obtain bail. She also asked
Ingham to swear to a number of falsehoods
about her intimacy with Trafton, and when he
refused to do so, for fear of being tried for perjury,
she said that she could get "her Billy" to
swear to anything. This "Billy" proved to be
one William Simpson, a barkeeper, and her former
paramour. He was tracked for some time by
my detectives, but he suddenly disappeared, and
was not seen again until her trial for larceny,
when, just as she said, he was willing to swear
to anything. He then disappeared again, but I
did not take much interest in following him up,
as I knew that he would not dare to repeat his
perjury when the murder trial should take place.
His testimony was to the effect that he had overheard
a conversation between Mrs. Sanford and
young Trafton, in which the latter acknowledged
that he was the father of Mrs. Sanford's child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>
having been intimate with her in Buffalo about
eighteen months before. The question of a support
for the child was discussed between them,
and Trafton said that he would give her fifteen
hundred or two thousand dollars in bonds, to
enable her to bring up his child in comfort. The
witness also testified that Trafton and Mrs. Sanford
were very intimate with each other, often
occupying the same room together; that Mrs.
Sanford often spoke of her former intimacy with
him; and that he inferred from their conversation
that Trafton had been the cause of her separation
from her husband. This testimony was
very skillfully manufactured and artistically developed,
so as to make Trafton appear in the
light of a libertine and profligate, and Mrs. Sanford
as a confiding wife, led astray by the wiles
of a treacherous man. In spite of the bad character
and appearance of this fellow Simpson, his
testimony had enough weight with some of the
jury to cause a disagreement, and Mrs. Sanford
was remanded to jail.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert S. Trafton was anxious to bring
her to punishment, as he felt confident that she
had caused the death of his son. The circumstances
of the case caused considerable delay, and
it was not until January 27, 1873, nearly a year
after her arrest, that the trial on the charge of
murder took place.</p>

<p>The testimony in this trial was highly interesting
on many accounts. The County Physician,
who had made the first post-mortem examination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
of the remains, and who had given congestion of
the lungs as the cause of death, stated that he
found the deceased lying dead in Mrs. Sanford's
rooms, and that he took charge of the property
found in his possession. He stated that he
should have made a closer examination if he had
not found the bonds and money; but he did not
suspect foul play, and therefore made only a
hasty investigation.</p>

<p>By the testimony of two or three witnesses it
was shown that on the night of Trafton's death
Mrs. Sanford went into two saloons about midnight,
asking for "her Billy," meaning the man
Simpson, by whose testimony she escaped conviction
on the larceny charge, he being then living
on her bounty. While looking for him she
was very wild and excited, her clothes being disordered,
and her watch-chain broken. To one
witness she said that she wished Billy to come to
her house to look at the "prettiest corpse she
ever saw." One witness testified that she returned
to his saloon about five or six o'clock in
the morning, and induced him to go up to her
rooms to look at the body; he did so, and found
the body of a man lying in bed, partly covered
up. She had a large roll of money and papers in
her pocket-book.</p>

<p>A surgeon of the highest reputation in Cleveland
was called, and gave his testimony in the
most direct and convincing manner, like a man
who knew perfectly well what he was talking
about, and who was not guessing at any of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
facts as stated by him. He declared that death
resulted from the blow on the right side, aided
by the violence on the throat and neck. There
was very slight congestion of the brain and of
the lungs, but he was positive that death was not
the result of either of these; indeed, leaving out
of consideration the marks of external violence,
he said that he should not have been able to account
for Mr. Trafton's death. At the conclusion
of his re-direct examination he said that death
could be caused by a heavy blow of the fist, followed
by choking, and he would swear positively
that Trafton's death was produced by violence.
The testimony of this witness was corroborated
by that of several other surgeons of high reputation,
and then a sensation was created by the calling
of John Ingham for the prosecution.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Sanford saw her well-beloved friend,
Jack, take the stand and acknowledge himself to
be one of Pinkerton's dreaded detectives, she
broke down and cried bitterly. Ingham related
the history of his connection with the affair,
stating the different stories which Mrs. Sanford
had told about Trafton's death, and also her fear
of going in the room where he died. He then
gave the inside history of his arrest for the
alleged robbery of Adamson, showing that it had
been planned in advance by me to induce Mrs.
Sanford to give him her confidence. After her
arrest for larceny, he had visited her in jail, and
she had tried to get him to swear that he had
heard Trafton promise to give her the bonds to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
support her child. When he objected, on the
ground that he might be arrested for perjury, she
had told him that "her Billy," meaning William
Simpson, would swear to it anyhow.</p>

<p>The testimony of Mr. Warner relative to finding
the bonds in Mrs. Sanford's possession was
corroborated by that of the constable; they also
repeated Mrs. Sanford's remark made during the
search, before any charge of murder had even
been suggested: "By the way you act, I should
think you were looking for a murdered man."</p>

<p>When the testimony for the prosecution was
all in, the defense had a turn, and they produced
as many medical experts to prove that Trafton
did not die of violence, as the other side had to
prove that he did not die a natural death; indeed,
from the medical testimony given, there might
have been grave doubts raised as to whether he
had any business to die at all, for, according to
both sides, no adequate cause of death had been
discovered. Several witnesses testified that they
believed him to have been on a long spree just
before his death, but these were soon rebutted by
equally trustworthy witnesses for the prosecution.</p>

<p>In summing up, the counsel for the people
presented a highly plausible theory of the manner
in which the murder was committed, and
asked a verdict on the following grounds:</p>

<p>Young Trafton, as shown by the testimony of
his father and others, visited Chicago to buy
grain, and he was, therefore, under the necessity
of carrying with him a large amount of money.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
Being unable to get a room at any hotel convenient
to business, he probably entered the first
place where he saw the sign, "Rooms to Rent,"
and engaged a sleeping-room, taking his meals at
a hotel near by. While lodging with Mrs. Sanford,
he was trying to buy grain at a paying
figure, and he was daily in consultation with
Captain Dalton, who commanded one of his
father's schooners. Finding that he could not
buy to any advantage in the existing condition
of the grain market, he sent the schooner back
to Cleveland on the last day of November, in
order that she should not be caught in the ice in
the straits at the close of navigation. He was
then ready to return himself, and, doubtless, on
going to his lodgings, he so informed Mrs. Sanford.
As he had made no secret of his reason
for visiting Chicago, she was, probably, well
aware of his object, and also of the fact that he
had a large amount of money with him. Seeing
his careless ways, the idea occurred to her to rob
him, and, having his expected departure in view,
she knew that she would have only one more
opportunity to carry out her scheme.</p>

<p>On his return that evening, therefore, having
just parted from Captain Dalton in perfect health
and sobriety, he was invited to eat supper with
her. Suspecting no harm, he sat down and ate
a hearty supper. In some way, either in his food
or drink, a dose of morphine was given to him,
and he soon fell fast asleep. The woman's opportunity
was before her, and all the natural thirst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
for money which characterized her came upon
her with full force, urging her on and inciting
her to any lengths necessary to accomplish her
object. Having laid him on his bed, she began
to search his pockets with the stealthy touch of a
practiced hand. Finding nothing at first to reward
her search, she pulled off one of his boots
and discovered the United States bonds, which
he had concealed there. But the violence necessary
to remove the boot caused him to partly
waken from his drugged sleep, and he became
vaguely aware that some one was trying to rob
him. Still in a drowsy, confused state, however,
he was unable to do more than to sit up and
clutch wildly at his assailant; having caught one
of the bonds, he clung to it until it was torn in
two pieces, the fragments plainly showing how
they had been wrenched asunder in the clasp of
two determined hands&mdash;those of the murderess
and her victim. But she soon found that he was
gaining his senses too rapidly, and that she
would be foiled in her attempted robbery; hence,
with every blinding passion aroused, her greed
and her fear equally inciting her to action, she
struck him a heavy blow on the thigh and another
more powerful one on the side. Partly
stunned by the concussion, he fell back, and she
then seized him by the throat. Her round, plump
hands, though powerful enough to strangle him,
left only slight marks of abrasion on the skin,
and in a few minutes all was over. His property
was at her mercy, and she gave no thought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
the body of her victim until she had seized every
piece of valuable paper in his possession.</p>

<p>But her position was a dangerous one, and, on
cooling off somewhat, she saw that something
must be done to remove any appearance of foul
play. How could it be done most effectually?
Manifestly by giving no apparent ground for suspecting
that she had any object in his death;
and no course would be more effectual than to
leave such an amount of property in his possession
as to make strangers believe that none of it
had been taken. It may well be imagined that
this was her hardest task; for to give up money
was probably a greater hardship for her than
for some people to give up life. Still, it would
never do to run the risk of being accused of murder;
so, reluctantly, she placed one bond in his
pocket, and, by accident, included with it one-half
of the torn bond, the other half being placed
under his head, in the boot from which it was
taken. She then undressed the body, placed it
naturally in bed, and went out to look for "her
Billy," her paramour and panderer in vice.</p>

<p>This was the history of the crime, as pictured
by the prosecution; and all her actions since
that fatal night had been in harmony with such
a theory. Her allegations of intimacy with
young Trafton were unsupported, save by the
testimony of this William Simpson, her paramour.
It was noticeable that, while this man
had testified in the trial for larceny that he had
overheard Mr. Trafton's acknowledgment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
being the father of Mrs. Sanford's child, in the
murder trial he was not asked to give any such
testimony, nor was the existence of such a child
even hinted at by the defense. The counsel for
Mrs. Sanford were well aware that she had never
had a child, and that this fact could be proven if
necessary. On discovering, too, that Jack Ingham
was a Pinkerton detective, instead of Mrs.
Sanford's best friend, they saw other reasons
why it would not be advisable to cause Mr. William
Simpson to perjure himself again.</p>

<p>The defense contented themselves with claiming
that there was no sufficient evidence to prove
that Mr. Trafton had died a violent death at all,
and that there was no evidence whatever to show
that, even if foul play had occurred, Mrs. Sanford
had been the guilty person. This plea was
ably presented by the counsel, and the judge
then briefly charged the jury as to the law, and
the form of their verdict. During the early part
of the trial, Mrs. Sanford behaved very badly,
often contradicting witnesses aloud, and making
many audible remarks to the jury and the Court;
after the testimony for the defense began,
however, she paid very little attention to the
proceedings, often dozing and sleeping in her
chair. This habit was, undoubtedly, due to the
use of morphine, of which she consumed large
quantities.</p>

<p>The jury retired at three o'clock, and, on the
first ballot, they stood nine for conviction and
three for acquittal. After discussing the testi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>mony
for more than four hours, a compromise
was reached, and the judge having been informed
that the jury had agreed upon a verdict,
the prisoner was brought in to hear the finding.</p>

<p>All being in readiness, the clerk read the
verdict as follows:</p>

<p>"We, the jury, find the defendant guilty of involuntary
manslaughter, and fix her time of
imprisonment at five years in the penitentiary."</p>

<p>At the word "guilty," Mrs. Sanford gave a
violent start; but, as the remainder of the finding
was read, she seemed to feel agreeably surprised.
She asked for a glass of water in a low tone,
turned very white, and then fainted away before
the water could be handed to her.</p>

<p>She was then removed to the jail to await the
argument on a motion for a new trial. While
there, she gave one of the most effectual evidences
of her ruling passion&mdash;greed. She was
the object of considerable sympathy among a certain
class of sentimentalists, and the amount of
compassion wasted upon her was remarkable to
those who knew her real character and habits;
but there is no accounting for tastes, and so Mrs.
Sanford was treated with great consideration by
a number of well-meaning but unsophisticated
people. Among the Good Samaritans who took
the most interest in her was a lady named Mrs.
Jones, and this lady visited her quite frequently
in her cell, bringing her books and papers.</p>

<p>One morning, Mrs. Jones complained of feeling
unwell, and Mrs. Sanford immediately gave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
her a glass of water. Soon after drinking it,
Mrs. Jones became very sleepy, and in a few
minutes, she was in a sound slumber. This effect
had been produced, of course, by a dose of
morphine in the water, and Mrs. Sanford then
proceeded to rob Mrs. Jones of all her valuables.
Mrs. Jones was in moderate circumstances, and
her purse was not sufficiently well filled to satisfy
Mrs. Sanford's avaricious demon; hence, she
made a thorough search for other plunder. It
happened that Mrs. Jones, having lost all of her
upper teeth, had supplied their place by an artificial
set, mounted on a plate of solid gold. Not
content, therefore, with plundering her benefactress
in other respects, Mrs. Sanford actually
took the set of teeth from Mrs. Jones's mouth,
and hid them in her own trunk.</p>

<p>Of course, on awakening, Mrs. Jones missed
her teeth and charged Mrs. Sanford with having
taken them. The latter denied having done so,
railed and swore at Mrs. Jones, and tried to prevent
the officers from searching the cell. The
teeth and other articles stolen from Mrs. Jones
were found at the bottom of Mrs. Sanford's
trunk, and Mrs. Jones retired from the jail
strongly impressed with the conviction that philanthropy
had its hardships as well as rewards.</p>

<p>The motion for a new trial being overruled,
sentence was pronounced in accordance with the
verdict of the jury, and Mrs. Sanford was consigned
to the Illinois State Penitentiary at Joliet.</p>

<p>In regard to the manner in which young Traf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>ton
was murdered, I have always had a theory of
my own; and, while of course I do not pretend to
any surgical learning, I give it for what it is
worth, prefacing it, however, with the remark
that several eminent physicians concur in my
opinion, or, at least, admit its strong probability.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Mrs. Sanford used
morphine continually, and that she boasted of
her ability to administer it in just the proper proportion
to cause her victims to fall into a heavy
sleep. In all probability, as suggested by the
State's Attorney, she gave young Trafton a dose
at supper; but it is also possible the effect was
not sufficient, and that when she tried to rob him,
he slightly revived, struggled, and, seizing one of
the bonds in a convulsive grasp, tore it in two.</p>

<p>So far, the theories are identical, but I failed to
see a sufficient cause of death in the slight blow
and mild choking, especially as the lungs did not
present the conditions which would have appeared
had death resulted from strangulation or
asphyxia. On searching Mrs. Sanford's rooms,
Mr. Warner found two or three small syringes,
intended for making hypodermic injections, and
these led me to believe she caused Trafton's death
by morphine alone. My idea was as follows:</p>

<p>When she found that Trafton was not sufficiently
drugged to enable her to rob him in safety,
she probably let him alone, and the drug again
took effect to the extent of putting him to sleep.
She then resorted to a subcutaneous injection of
morphine, knowing that the soporific influence of
the drug would thus be made more rapid and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
powerful. This operation was performed on the
side, and then near the large veins of the leg, and
thus were caused the apparent bruises filled with
extravasated blood. Now, the effect of morphine
varies largely, according to the constitution, temperament,
and habits of the persons to whom it
is given; but the combined result of internal and
external doses almost invariably is death.</p>

<p>It seems altogether probable to me, therefore,
that Trafton came to his death in that manner,
and that the traces of morphine in the wounds,
as in the stomach, had wholly evaporated before
the Cleveland surgeons made their examination,
twelve days after death.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the means, however,
there can be no doubt that murder most foul was
committed, and that Mrs. Sanford richly deserved
a greater punishment than was awarded to her.
Whether she had any accomplice will never be
known, but it is probable that she had some one
in the house who was aware of the murder after
it had been committed, if not before. This
would account for the absence of the fifth bond,
which was never recovered, but which was afterward
traced back from the Treasury Department,
when it was presented there, to some unknown
woman, who had sold it in Milwaukee.
This woman was evidently not Mrs. Sanford, but
her identity could not be discovered, and, therefore,
all trace was lost.</p>
