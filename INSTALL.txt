Upgrading requires a complete reinstall (save header.txt, setting.rc,
and any files you wish to keep in the data/ directory, although in
theory these should not be overwritten).

WINDOWS

On Windows, unzip the the file guiguts-win-n.n.n.zip into a directory
and run guiguts.bat. You will also need to install helper applications
to view images and to spell check. If you already have another version
of Perl installed, see below.

MAC

On Mac, an executable is provided in guiguts-mac-n.n.n.zip.

OTHER

For other platforms, you will need to install Perl. See:

NOTES FOR WINDOWS USERS WITH AN EXISTING PERL INSTALLATION

The easiest way to get guiguts up and running on a Windows system is to
download guiguts-win-n.n.n.zip and run guiguts.bat. This calls an old
version of perl with Tk.pm, 5.8, in a subdirectory by adding that
subdirectory to your path. This will not work if you have other versons
of perl without Tk.pm earlier on your path. Type "perl -v" to find out
which version you are using. If you want to use an existing version of
Perl, you can use Strawberry perl 5.12 or earlier or ActiveState perl
5.10 or earlier, if you install Tk.pm from cpan. No one has been able to
install Tk.pm with ActiveState perl 5.12 or 5.14--but it would help if
people file bug reports say this at cpan because there are semi-active
maintainers of Tk.pm.
