# Upgrading

Upgrading Guiguts involves installing the new version in a directory and
copying a few files over from the prior install. This document walks you
through all the steps.

This document assumes you have Guiguts installed in `c:\guiguts`. If you have
this installed in a different location, you will need to adjust the paths
below accordingly. Despite the instructions using Windows paths, the overall
steps below work for all operating systems.

1. Backup your old installation. It is highly recommended that you backup your
   prior Guiguts installation before continuing.
2. Rename your old Guiguts directory (eg: `c:\guiguts`) to a new one
   (eg: `c:\guiguts-old`).
3. Follow the instructions in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) to install Guiguts
   for your operating system, including any helper applications, noting that
   if you are upgrading from release 1.0.25 or earlier on Windows, you must
   install Strawberry Perl _before_ trying to install and run Guiguts.
   _Note the requirement to run `install_cpan_modules.pl` to ensure all
   necessary Perl modules are installed._
4. Review and possibly copy over changes made to Guiguts files.
   * The `setting.rc` file stores Guiguts configurations. This file is
     automatically generated by Guiguts if it doesn't exist. Newer versions of
     Guiguts will include updated defaults, such as DP URLs and bundled tool
     locations. It is recommended that you **do not copy** this file from your
     old version but let the new Guiguts create the file afresh. You may then
     have some preferences you want to change within Guiguts which will be
     saved in this file.
   * The files in the `data` directory contain words used in HTML generation
     like Footnote and Page, so they can be customized for different
     languages. If you have changed these in the old release, copy the
     relevant ones to the new release. This will not apply to most users.
   * The file `headerdefault.txt` has had important changes made to it in this
     release. When you first run Guiguts, it copies this file to one named
     `header.txt`. If you have customized your `header.txt` in a previous
     release, you may want to retain those changes in the new release.
     If you are upgrading from a 1.3.x release, you can copy `header.txt` from
     the old release to the new one after you have run and exited Guiguts once.
     If you are upgrading from an older release, e.g. 1.0.25, 1.1.x or 1.2.x,
     you should follow the steps below to ensure you get all the updates:
     1. In the old directory compare `header.txt` with `headerdefault.txt`,
        making note of any differences.
     2. Run the newly installed Guiguts program to create the new `header.txt`
        then immediately exit.
     3. Edit `header.txt` in the new directory and make the changes you want
        to carry over from the old release.

   * If you were using `@media handheld` in your customized header file, please
     note that it is now deprecated. The same effects can be achieved using
     the `x-ebookmaker` class as described [here](https://www.pgdp.net/wiki/DP_Official_Documentation:PP_and_PPV/DP_HTML_Best_Practices/Case_Studies/Media_Types_and_Mobile_Formats).
     Alternatively, ask in the [DP forum Help with: guiguts thread](https://www.pgdp.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=11466).

You can now run Guiguts from the new installation directory.
