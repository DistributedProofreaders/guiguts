# Upgrading

Upgrading Guiguts involves installing the new version in a directory and
copying a few files over from the prior install. This document walks you
through all the steps.

This document assumes you have Guiguts installed in `c:\guiguts`. If you have
this installed in a different location, you will need to adjust the paths
below accordingly. Despite the instructions using Windows paths, the overall
steps below work for all operating systems.

1. Backup your old installation. It is highly recommended that you backup your
   prior Guiguts installation before continuing.
2. Rename your old Guiguts directory (eg: `c:\guiguts`) to a new one
   (eg: `c:\guiguts-old`).
3. Follow the instructions in [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) to install Guiguts
   for your operating system, including any helper applications. _Note the
   requirement to run `install_cpan_modules.pl` to ensure all necessary
   Perl modules are installed._
4. Review and possibly copy over changes made to Guiguts files.
   * The `setting.rc` file stores Guiguts configurations. This file is
     automatically generated by Guiguts if it doesn't exist. Newer versions of
     Guiguts will include updated defaults, such as DP URLs and bundled tool
     locations. It is recommended that you **do not copy** this file from your
     old version but let the new Guiguts create the file afresh. You may then
     have some preferences you want to change within Guiguts which will be
     saved in this file.
   * The files in the `data` directory contain words used in HTML generation
     like Footnote and Page, so they can be customized for different
     languages. If you have changed these in the old release, copy the
     relevant ones to the new release. This will not apply to most users.
   * The file `headerdefault.txt` has had important changes made to it in this
     release. When you first run Guiguts, it copies this file to one named
     `header.txt`. If you made changes to `header.txt`, or are unsure whether
     you did or what they were:
     1. In the old directory compare `header.txt` with `headerdefault.txt`,
        making note of any differences.
     2. Run the newly installed Guiguts program to create the new `header.txt`
        then immediately exit.
     3. Edit `header.txt` in the new directory and make the changes you want
        to carry over from the old release.

You can now run Guiguts from the new installation directory.
