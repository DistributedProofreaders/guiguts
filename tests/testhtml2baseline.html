<h2><a name="Preface" id="Preface">Preface</a></h2>


<p>Within recent years fairly exhaustive studies have been made on
many aspects of American science and technology. For example,
there have been numerous works relating to clocks and clockmakers,
so that the collector and horological student have a number of
useful sources on which to rely. More recently there has been a
series of publications on the development of American tools and
their makers. Until now, however, no systematic study has been
attempted of the scientific instruments used in the United States
from its colonial beginnings. While several useful regional lists
of instrument makers in early America have been compiled from
advertisements in contemporary newspapers and published as
short articles, these, however, are fragmentary, and are inadequate
to the need for documentation in this field.</p>

<p>With the rapidly growing interest in the history of science, it
becomes necessary to have a more complete background for the
student and the historian alike. It is desirable to have a more
comprehensive picture of the work of the scientific practitioners of
the earlier periods of American scientific development, and of their
tools. At the same time it is essential to have a history of the
development and distribution and use of scientific instruments by
others than the practitioners and teachers. The role of the instrument
maker in the American Colonies was an important one&mdash;as
it was in each epoch of the history of science in Europe&mdash;and it
deserves to be reported.</p>

<p>To make a comprehensive study of American scientific instruments
and instrument makers in the American Colonies is no
simple matter, partly because of an indifference to the subject in
the past, and partly because of the great volume of sources that
must be sifted to accomplish it. Such a project would require
an organized search of all published reference works relating to the
field and associated topics, of all contemporary newspapers for
advertisements and notices, of civil records filed in state and community
archives, of business account-books and records that have
been preserved, and of business directories of the period under
consideration. In addition, such a study would require the compilation
of an inventory of all surviving instruments in private and
public collections, and a correlation of all the data that could be
assembled from these sources.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span></p>
<p>The present study attempts only in part to accomplish this aim,
being no more than a preliminary compilation of the scientific
instruments known to have been used during the first two centuries
of American colonial existence. It merely attempts to assemble
all the data that is presently available in scattered sources, and
to organize it in a usable form for the student and historian of
American science. A supplement relating to 19th-century instruments
and instrument makers is in progress.</p>

<p>The most that is hoped for the present work is that it will be
of temporary assistance, serving to bring forth additional information
on the subject from sources not previously available or known.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Tools_of_Science" id="The_Tools_of_Science"><i>The Tools of Science</i></a></h2>


<p>Philosophical and Practical Instruments</p>

<p>Development of the sciences in the American Colonies was
critically dependent upon the available tools&mdash;scientific instruments&mdash;and
the men who made and used them. These tools may
be separated into two groups. The first group consists of philosophical
instruments and scientific teaching apparatus produced
and employed for experimentation and teaching in educational
institutions. The second includes the so-called "mathematical
instruments" of practical use, which were employed by mathematical
practitioners and laymen alike for the mensural and nautical
needs of the Colonies. It is particularly with this second
group that the present study is concerned.</p>

<p>It has been generally assumed that scientific instruments, as well
as the instrument makers, of the first two centuries of American
colonization were imported from England, and that the movement
declined by the beginning of the 19th century with the development
of skilled native craftsmen.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> This assumption is basically true for
those instruments grouped under philosophical and scientific apparatus
for experimentation and teaching. Almost all of these items
were in fact imported from England and France until well into the
19th century.</p>

<p>Likewise, the very earliest examples of mathematical instruments
for surveying and navigation in the Colonies were imported with
the settlers from England. It was not long after the establishment
of the first settlements, however, that the settlers, and later the
first generation of native Americans, began to produce their own
instruments. Records derived from historical archives and from
the instruments themselves reveal that a considerable number of
the instruments available and used in the Colonies before 1800
were of native production. Apparently, relatively few instrument
makers immigrated to the American continent before the end of the
Revolutionary War. Later, with the beginning of the 19th century,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
makers of and dealers in instruments in England and France
became aware of the growing new market, and emigrated in numbers
to establish shops in the major cities of commerce in the
United States.</p>

<p>Quite possibly the few instrument makers trained in England
who immigrated to the Colonies in the early epoch of Colonial
development may have in turn trained others in their communities,
although no evidence has yet been found. Perhaps more data on
this aspect of the subject will eventually come to light.</p>

<p>There is reason to believe that a few mathematical practitioners
and instrument makers lived and worked in the New England
colonies as early as the first century of colonization.</p>

<p>The evidence, frankly meager, consists of two items. The first
is a reference relating to James Halsie of Boston. In a land deed
made out to him in 1674 he was referred to as a "Mathematician."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Halsie was listed as a freeman of the Massachusetts Bay Colony
in 1690. He apparently was the forbear of the several members of
the Halsy family of instrument makers of Boston of the 18th
century, mentioned later in this study. It is uncertain whether the
use of the term "mathematician" in this connection meant an
artisan, but if not it may be inferred that Halsie was a practitioner.</p>

<p>The second piece of evidence is even more slender; it consists of
an inscription upon a dialing rule (fig. 1) for making sundials and
charts. The instrument is of cast brass, 20-7/16 inches long and
1-11/16 inches wide. The date "1674" is inscribed on the rule together
with the name of its original owner, "Arthur Willis." The instrument
almost certainly was produced by the school of Henry
Sutton, the notable English instrument maker who worked in
Threadneedle Street in London from about 1637 through 1665.
The name and date inscriptions are consistent and contemporary
with the workmanship of the rule, and were probably inscribed by
the maker for the original owner. It is conceivable that Arthur
Willis was an Englishman and that the rule was brought into this
country even in relatively recent times. However, it is claimed
that the rule was owned and used by Nathaniel Footes, surveyor
of Springfield, Massachusetts. Nathaniel Footes, believed to have
been originally from Salem, subsequently moved from Springfield
to Wethersfield, Conn. The instrument was later owned and used
in Connecticut not later than the early 19th century<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a><br /><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> forbears
of Mr. Newton C. Brainard of Hartford, Connecticut. If
records relating to Willis as a resident of the New England colonies
can be recovered, it may then be possible to establish whether he
worked in the Colonies as a mathematical practitioner in the 17th
century. His name is included on a tentative basis.</p>

<p>The Need for Instruments</p>

<p>The production and use of scientific instruments in the American
Colonies reflected colonial development in education and in territorial
and economic expansion, and closely paralleled the same
development in England, where the first mathematical practitioners
were the teachers of navigational and commercial arithmetic
and the surveyors employed in the redistribution of land
following the dissolution of the monasteries. As the communities
became established and the settlers gained a foothold on the soil,
their attention naturally turned to improving their lot by expanding
the land under cultivation and by trading their products for other
needs. The growth of the communities became increasingly rapid
from the end of the 17th century, and the land expansion closely
paralleled the development of trade. The educational institutions
placed greater emphasis on the sciences as their curriculums
developed. Particularly there was a greater preoccupation with
the sciences on the part of the layman because of the need for
knowledge of surveying and navigation.</p>

<p>The colonial school curriculum was accordingly designed from
the practical point of view to emphasize practical mathematics, and
there was an increasing demand for instruction in all aspects of the
subject. One of the earliest advertisements of this nature appeared
in <i>The Boston Gazette</i> in March 1719. In the issue of February 19
to March 7 the advertisement stated that:</p>

<blockquote><p>This day Mr. Samuel Grainger opens his school at the House formerly
Sir Charles Hobby's, where will be taught Grammar Writing after a free and
easy manner in all the usual Hands, Arithmetick in a concise and Practical
Method, Merchants Accompts, and the Mathematicks.</p>

<p>He hopes that more thinking People will in no wise be discouraged from
sending their children thither, on the account of the reports newly reviv'd,
because these dancing Phaenomena's were never seen nor heard of in School
Hours.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>
<p>The advertisement was further amplified in its second appearance,
in the issue of March 21-22, 1719:</p>

<blockquote><p>At the house formerly Sir Charles Hobby's are taught grammar, writing,
after a free &amp; easy manner in all hands usually practiced, Arithmetick Vulgar
and Decimal in a concise and Practical Method, Merchants Accompts,
Geometry, Algebra, Mensuration, Geography, Trigonometry, Astronomy,
Navigation and other parts of the Mathematicks, with the use of the Globes
and other Mathematical Instruments, by Samuel Grainger.</p>

<p>They whose business won't permit 'em to attend the usual School Hours,
shall be carefully attended and Instructed in the Evenings.</p></blockquote>

<p>R. F. Seybold<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> has noted that: "In advertisements of 1753
and 1754, John Lewis, of New York City, announced 'What is
called a New Method of Navigation, is an excellent Method of
Trigonometry here particularly applied to Navigation; But it is
of great use in all kinds of measuring and in solving many Arithmetical
Questions.' James Cosgrove, of Philadelphia, in 1755,
taught 'geometry, trigonometry, and their application in surveying,
navigation, etc.,' and Alexander Power, in 1766, 'With
their Application to Surveying, Navigation, Geography, and
Astronomy'." These subjects were featured also in the evening
schools of the colonial period, maintained by private schoolmasters
in some of the larger communities for the education of those who
could not attend school in the daytime.</p>

<p>According to Seybold, surveying and navigation were the most
popular mathematical subjects taught. Some explanation is to be
derived from the statement by Schoen<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> that: "In the days when
the 'bounds' of great wilderness tracts were being marked off by
deep-cut blazes in the trees along a line, a knowledge of land surveying
was a useful skill, and many a boy learned its elements by
following the 'boundsgoer' in his work of 'running the line.' And
those who did not actually take part in running the line must have
attended many a gay springtime 'processioning' when neighbors
made a festive occasion out of 'perambulating the bounds'." "Vague
land grants and inaccurate surveys," he adds, "made the subject
of boundary lines a prime issue in the everyday life of colonial
homes."</p>

<p>At the same time there was interest in the other aspects of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>mathematical sciences. As early as 1743, for instance, a Harvard
mathematician named Nathan Prince advertised in Boston that
if he were given "suitable Encouragement" he would establish a
school to teach "Geography and Astronomy, With the Use of the
Globes, and the several kinds of Projecting the Sphere" among
other things.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> A decade later, Theophilus Grew, professor in the
academy at Philadelphia which has become the University of Pennsylvania,
published a treatise on globes, with the title:</p>

<blockquote><p><i>The Description</i> and <i>Use</i> of the <i>Globes</i>, Celestial and Terrestrial; With
Variety for <i>Examples</i> for the Learner's <i>Exercises</i>: Intended for the Use of
Such Persons as would attain to the Knowledge of those <i>Instruments</i>; But

<p>Thus, the need for practical mathematical instruments for the
surveyor and navigator became critical in proportion to the need
for men to make and use them, and it is not surprising to discover
that the majority of the instruments produced and advertised by
early American makers were for surveying, with nautical instruments
in second place. Generally, the surveyors were not professionals;
they were farmers, tradesmen, or craftsmen with a sound
knowledge of basic arithmetic and occasionally with some advanced
study of the subject as taught in the evening schools. The surveying
of provincial and intercolonial boundaries required greater
skill, however, as well as a knowledge of astronomy, and this work
was relegated to the scientific men of the period.</p>

<p>As the increasing preoccupation with subdivision of land and with
surveying led to a greater demand for suitable instruments, it was
the skilled craftsmen of the community, such as the clockmaker
and the silversmith, that were called upon to produce them.
Superb examples also were produced by the advanced scientific
men, or "mathematical practitioners," of the period.</p>


<p>Colonial Training in Instrument Making</p>

<p>One may well ask, where did these native craftsmen acquire the
knowledge that enabled them to produce so skillfully the accurate
and often delicate mathematical instruments? There were a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a><br /><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
number of possible sources for this knowledge. The first source
lies in England, where some of these craftsmen could have studied
or served apprenticeships. After completing their apprenticeship
with English mathematical practitioners, they may have immigrated
to the Colonies and taught the craft to others. This seems
to be entirely plausible, and was probably true, for example, of
Thomas Harland the clockmaker, Anthony Lamb, and perhaps
several others. However, these were the exceptions instead of the
rule, since a biographical study of the instrument makers in general
reveals that they were for the most part native to America. It is
not likely that the one or two isolated practitioners that had been
trained in England could have taught so many others who worked
in the same epoch.</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 2.&mdash;Title page of <i>The Surveyor</i> by Aaron Rathborne, published in London
in 1616. The book was one of the sources of information for American makers
of mathematical instruments.]</p>

<p>Another source for this knowledge of instrument making was
probably the reference works on the subject that had been published
in England and in France. As an example, Nicolas Bion's
<i>Traitè de la Construction et des Principaux Usages des Instruments
de Mathematique</i>, which had been first published in 1686, was
translated into English by Edmund Stone in 1723, and went into
several English editions. Copies of this work in English undoubtedly
found their way to America soon after publication. Other
popular works were Aaron Rathbone's <i>The Surveyor</i>, which
appeared in London in 1616 (see fig. 2); William Leybourn's <i>The
Compleat Surveyor</i>, in 1653; and George Atwell's <i>Faithfull Surveyour</i>,
in 1662. Other works popular in the Colonies were R. Norwood's
<i>Epitome, or The Doctrine of Triangles</i> (London, 1659) and J. Love's
<i>Geodasia, or the Art of Surveying</i> (London, 1688).</p>

<p>These works undoubtedly inspired similar publications in America,
for many books on surveying and navigation appeared there
before the beginning of the 19th century. Chief among them
were S. Moore's <i>An Accurate System of Surveying</i> (Litchfield, Conn.,
1796), Z. Jess's <i>A Compendious System of Practical Surveying</i>
(Wilmington, 1799), Abel Flint's <i>Surveying</i> (Hartford, 1804), and
J. Day's <i>Principles of Navigation and Surveying</i> (New Haven, 1817).</p>

<p>The published works were unquestionably responsible for much
of the training in the making of mathematical instruments in
America, although no documentary evidence has yet been recovered
to prove it.</p>

<p>Another important influence on early American instrument-making
which must be noted was that of the clockmaker as an
artisan. A comprehensive study of surviving instruments and
related records has revealed that only a few of the many cl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>ockmakers
working in the American Colonies in the 18th century made
mathematical instruments. Yet, a large proportion of the surviving
surveying and nautical instruments produced before 1800 were
the work of clockmakers. Classic among these must be noted the
instruments produced by the brothers David and Benjamin Rittenhouse
(see p. 15 and figs. 3 and 4), as well as the fine surveying
instruments made by four separate members of the Chandlee
family, whose clockmaking traditions began early in the 17th century
(see p. 54).</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 4.&mdash;Surveying compass marked "Potts and Rittenhouse." Believed to be

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>
<p>Finally, one must not overlook the fact that examples of English
and other European instruments were available in the Colonies,
and that at least some of the early colonial makers undoubtedly
copied them. It is apparent from some surviving early American
instruments that the materials, designs, dimensions, and details of
European prototypes had been deliberately copied. It is possible
to see in public collections, for instance, a Davis quadrant of English
manufacture exhibited beside a later example, signed by a New
England maker, which comes extraordinarily close to duplicating
it in every feature.</p>

<p>As with the presumed influence of published works, the practice
of copying imported instruments cannot be documented, but it
must have been engaged in by many of the unschooled New England
instrument makers. By this means some may even have
profited to the degree that they became professional craftsmen
without benefit of formal apprenticeship.</p>

<p>Yet it is remarkable that although numerous instruments were
produced by native artisans, in addition to the substantial number
which were imported before the end of the 18th century, relatively
few specimens have survived in public collections as well as in
private hands. Despite the exhaustive combing of attics and barns
throughout the country by dealers in antiques and by avid collectors
during the past several decades, the number of surviving
instruments now known is incredibly small in comparison with the
numbers known to have been made locally or imported before the
beginning of the 19th century. Since instruments are not items
which would ordinarily be deliberately discarded or destroyed, or
melted down for the recovery of the metal, this small percentage
of survival presents a puzzle which has not been resolved.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Mathematical_Practitioners" id="The_Mathematical_Practitioners"><i>The Mathematical Practitioners</i></a></h2>


<p>The Rittenhouse Brothers</p>

<p>Notable among the American practitioners was David Rittenhouse
(1732-1796) of Norristown and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
who was established as a clockmaker and surveyor in Philadelphia
by 1749. He surveyed the boundary between Pennsylvania and
Delaware in 1763 with instruments of his own design and construction.
Six years later, in 1769, he successfully calculated the
transit of Venus and later observed that planet with astronomical
instruments he had constructed himself. In the following year,
1770, he built the first American astronomical observatory, in
Philadelphia. Two orreries that he designed and built&mdash;at the
University of Pennsylvania and at Princeton University&mdash;survive
as outstanding examples of American craftsmanship.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Several of
his surveying and astronomical instruments are exhibited in the
collections of the U.S. National Museum. David Rittenhouse
is credited with being the originator of a declination arc on the
surveying compass, a feature to be copied by a number of later
instrument makers.</p>

<p>David's brother, Benjamin Rittenhouse (1740-c.1820), served
in the Revolution and was wounded at Brandywine. He superintended
the Government's gunlock factory at Philadelphia in
1778 and achieved recognition as a maker of clocks and surveying
instruments (see fig. 8).<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> During one period of his career he worked
in partnership with his brother David. An interesting advertisement
appeared in the May 14, 1785, issue of <i>The Pennsylvania
Packet</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>WANTED, An ingenious Lad not exceeding 14 years of age, of a reputable
family, as an Apprentice to learn the Art and Mistery of making Clocks and
Surveying Instruments. Any lad inclining to go an apprentice to the above
Trade, the terms on which he will be taken may [be] known by enquiring of
Mr. David Rittenhouse, in Philadelphia, or at the subscriber's house in
Worcester township, Montgomery county. Benjamin Rittenhouse.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Andrew Ellicott</p>

<p>A name closely associated with that of the Rittenhouse brothers
was that of Andrew Ellicott (1754-1820) of Solebury, Pennsylvania,
and Ellicotts Mills, Maryland. Andrew was the son of Joseph
Ellicott, the clockmaker and pioneer industrialist who founded
Ellicotts Mills. Although a Quaker, Andrew (fig. 9) served in
the Revolution, and he became one of the most distinguished
engineers of the new republic. He worked as a clockmaker and
instrument maker from 1774 to 1780. In 1784 he ran the boundary
between Virginia and Pennsylvania and in the following year he
was a member of the survey that continued Mason and Dixon's
line. In 1785 and 1786 he served on the Pennsylvania commissions
that surveyed the western and northern boundaries of the state,
and in 1789 he served on the commission that fixed the boundary
between New York and Pennsylvania. Between 1791 and 1793 he
surveyed the site of the city of Washington, D.C., and redrew
L'Enfant's plan for the city.</p>

<p>In early 1793 Ellicott was appointed commissioner by the
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for the project of viewing and
locating a road from Reading to Presque Isle, now Erie. It was
an extremely difficult undertaking, but Ellicott completed the
work by the autumn of 1796, including laying out the towns of
Erie, Warren, and Franklin.</p>

<p>In May 1796 Ellicott was commissioned by President Washington
to survey and mark the boundary line between the United States
and the Spanish Province of Florida in accordance with the
provisions of the Pinkney-Godoy Treaty of October 27, 1795.
This line was to begin at the point where the 31st parallel of north
latitude intersected the Mississippi River, and to proceed thence
along that parallel eastward to the Appalachicola River for about
400 miles.</p>

<p>In 1801 Ellicott was offered the position of surveyor general of
the United States by President Jefferson. Ellicott declined, but
subsequently accepted the secretaryship of the land office of
Pennsylvania, a post he held until 1808.</p>

<p>In 1811 Ellicott became commissioner to represent Georgia in
locating the Georgia-North Carolina boundary, a project on which
he was engaged for the major part of the following year.</p>

<p>In 1815 President Madison appointed Ellicott professor of
mathematics at West Point, with the rank of major. This is an
appointment he kept until his death in 1820. It was interrupted
in 1817 when the Government required his services as astronomer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a><br /><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
to locate a portion of the United States-Canadian boundary in
accordance with the fifth article of the Treaty of Ghent.</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 10.&mdash;Transit and equal-altitude instrument (left) made by Ellicott in 1789

Florida and in other surveys. USNM 152080.]</p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 11.&mdash;Zenith sector with focal length of 6 ft., made by David Rittenhouse
and revised by Andrew Ellicott. Described in <i>Journal of Andrew Ellicott</i>
(Philadelphia, 1803). USNM 152078.]</p>

<p>Ellicott was a member of a number of learned societies, including
the American Philosophical Society, the Society for the Promotion
of Useful Arts of Albany, and of the National Institute of France.</p>

<p>Ellicott constructed a number of instruments for surveying and
astronomical observation, and he designed and used others that
were produced by his friend David Rittenhouse<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> (see figs. 10, 11).
Of particular interest in connection with Ellicott's career as a
clockmaker and instrument maker are two advertisements that
appeared in the Baltimore newspapers. The first one was in the
<i>Maryland Journal and Baltimore Daily Advertiser on April 7, 1778</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Ellicott's Upper Mills, April 4, 1778. Wanted, a person acquainted with the
Clock-Making business, and able to work by directions. Such a person will
meet with good encouragement by applying to Andrew Ellicott, sen.</p></blockquote>

<p>The second advertisement, in the same vein, appeared in the May
16, 1780, issue of the <i>Maryland Journal</i>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Good Encouragement will be given to either Clock or Mathematical instrument
makers, by the subscriber, living in Baltimore-Town. Andrew Ellicott.</p></blockquote>


<p>Owen Biddle</p>

<p>Another mathematical practitioner associated with David Rittenhouse
in his observations of the transit of Venus was Owen
Biddle (1737-1799) of the North Ward, Philadelphia.</p>

<p>In early life Biddle was an apothecary and a clock- and watch-maker.
In his shop "next door to Roberts warehouse" he sold
clock and watch parts and tools. From 1764 to 1770 he advertised
himself as "Clockmaker, and scientist, statesman and patriot."
As a Quaker, he participated actively in civic and patriotic affairs
of Philadelphia. During the American Revolution, in spite of his
religious affiliation, he fought for the defense of the Colonies and
was appointed Deputy Commissioner of Forage. Evidencing sincere
repentance, he was permitted to rejoin the Society of Friends.</p>

<p>In 1769 Biddle took an active part in the preparations made by
the American Philosophical Society for the observation of the
transit of Venus. With Joel Baily he was sent to Cape Henlopen,
Delaware, with a large reflecting telescope borrowed from the
Library Company. The expedition was described in the <i>Trans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>actions
of the American Philosophical Society</i> in 1771 in an article entitled
"An Account of the Transit of Venus, over the Sun's Disk, as
observed near Cape Henlopen, on Delaware Bay, June 3rd, 1769
by Owen Biddle, Joel Baily and (Richard Thomas) Drawn by
Owen Biddle." In addition to his trade in clocks and watches,
Biddle also made mathematical instruments and was well known
in his native city as a merchant, inventor, and ironmaster.</p>


<p>Benjamin Banneker</p>

<p>A name that is too often ignored in the history of science in colonial
America is that of a free Negro, Benjamin Banneker (c. 1734-1806)
of Baltimore. A farmer by occupation, Banneker was the
son of a native African slave and a free mulatto woman. In his
spare time he attended the school of a Quaker farmer; the only
book he owned was the Bible. When he was a young man he acquired
a watch from a trader, and from it he developed his love of
science and instruments. Although he had never seen a clock, he
constructed one based on drawings he made from the watch.
Banneker was called upon to assist in the construction of the mills
for the Ellicotts, and it was natural that his clock, which was the
marvel of the Negro settlement, should come to the attention of
Joseph Ellicott. Ellicott became interested in Banneker's thirst
for knowledge and allowed him the use of his tools, scientific instruments,
and technical books. Among the books were Mayer's
<i>Tables</i>, James Ferguson's <i>Astronomy</i>, and Leadbeater's <i>Lunar
Tables</i>. Banneker absorbed these and other works that he borrowed
and went on to explore the wonderful new world they opened
up for him. He pursued astronomical studies, and within three
years he began to make calculations (fig. 12) for an almanac. After
completing the calculations for the year 1791, he went on to produce
a set of calculations for 1792. During this period he mastered
the use of surveying instruments and made a firsthand study of
tides in the region. His great opportunity came when Andrew
Ellicott was chosen to make a survey for the city of Washington
and hired Banneker as an assistant. While thus employed, Banneker
completed his almanac and gave it to George Ellicott,
Andrew's cousin, as a subject of possible interest. Apparently
George Ellicott turned it over to the Honorable James McHenry
of Baltimore, who in turned submitted it to the Philadelphia firm
of Goddard &amp; Angell, who published it (fig. 13). Banneker mailed
a copy of his <i>Benjamin Banneker's Pennsylvania, Delaware, Vir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a><br /><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>ginia
And Maryland Almanac and Ephemeris For the Year of Our
Lord, 1792</i> to Thomas Jefferson, who was so impressed with it
that he forwarded it to the Marquis de Condorcet, secretary of the
French Academy of Sciences. After his work with Ellicott had
been completed, Banneker retired to his farm to produce almanacs
annually until 1802. When he died in 1806 he was eulogized before
the French Academy by the Marquis de Condorcet, and William
Pitt placed his name in the records of the English Parliament.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

13, 1789, regarding astronomical data for the compilation of Banneker's
almanac. Photo courtesy Maryland Historical Society.]</p>


<p>Joel Baily</p>

<p>Still another 18th-century practitioner was Joel Baily (1732-1797),
a Quaker of West Bradford, Pennsylvania. In addition to
his trade as a clockmaker and gunsmith, Baily achieved local
eminence as an astronomer, mathematician, and surveyor.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>In 1764, at the time that Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon
established their headquarters near his farm, Baily was the local
surveyor. Obtaining employment with the expedition, he worked
with Mason and Dixon until the completion of their survey in 1768.
Baily was subsequently employed by Mason and Dixon to build
pine frames for carrying the 20-foot rods to be used in the second
measurement of courses from the Stargazers' Stone southward.</p>

<p>In 1769 Baily was appointed by the American Philosophical
Society to work with Owen Biddle in setting up the station at Cape
Henlopen for observation of the transit of Venus. In 1770 he
again worked with Biddle in taking the courses and distances from
the New Castle Court House to the State House Observatory in
Philadelphia for determining the latitude and longitude of each.
In the same year Baily was elected a member of the American
Philosophical Society.</p>


<p>Reverend John Prince</p>

<p>Another noteworthy mathematical practitioner of the period was
the Reverend John Prince (1751-1836) of Salem, Massachusetts.
The son of a hatter and mechanic, Prince studied natural phil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a><br /><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>osophy
under John Winthrop at Harvard and received his B.A.
degree in 1776. He was a student of divinity under Samuel
Williams and was ordained in 1779 at the First Church in Salem.
Although an amateur of the sciences, Prince became a skilled
maker of scientific instruments. He made, sold, and repaired
instruments for the use of numerous colleges, schools, and academies,
including Brown, Dartmouth, Rutgers, Harvard, Union,
Amherst, and Williams. Among other accomplishments, he
effected "improvements" on the lucernal microscope and the air
pump.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>[Illustration: Figure 13.&mdash;Title page of one of Banneker's almanacs. The portrait of Banneker
was made by Timothy Woods in 1793 for the publisher and reproduced by
woodcut. Banneker's first almanac was published in Philadelphia in 1792.]</p>


<p>Amasa Holcomb</p>

<p>Although he was born in the 18th century, Amasa Holcomb
(1787-1875) properly belongs to a later period. An astronomer
and telescope maker of Southwick, Massachusetts, Holcomb
became a surveyor in 1808. An autobiographical sketch noted
that "he manufactured about this time a good many sets of surveyors
instruments&mdash;compasses, chains, scales, protractors and dividers,
some for his pupils and some for others."<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<h2><a name="Instruments_of_Metal" id="Instruments_of_Metal">Instruments of Metal</a></h2>


<p>Pre-Revolutionary Immigrant Makers</p>

<p>According to present evidence, only a few makers of metal
instruments emigrated from England to the Colonies before the
beginning of the Revolutionary War. A slightly larger number
emigrated after the war had ended. In almost every instance, the
immigrant instrument makers settled in the major cities, which
were the shipping centers of the new country. The reason is
obvious: in these cities there was the greatest demand for nautical
and other instruments.</p>

<p>One of the earliest immigrant instrument makers arrived in
Boston in 1739. According to an advertisement that appeared in
<i>The Boston Gazette</i> in the issue of July 16-23, 1739, there had</p>

<blockquote><p>Arriv'd here by Capt. <i>Gerry</i> from <i>London</i> John Dabney, junr. who serv'd his
time to Mr. Jonathan Sisson, Mathematical Instrument Maker to his Royal
Highness, the Prince of Wales. Makes and sells all sorts of Mathematical
Instruments, in Silver, Brass, or Ivory, at Reasonable Rates, at Mr. Rowland
Houghton's Shop the north side of the Town Huse in Boston.</p>

<p>N.B. Said Dabney, sets Loadstones to a greater Perfection than any
heretofore.</p></blockquote>

<p>Dabney's master, Jonathan Sisson (1694-1749) originally of
Lincolnshire, with a shop in the Strand, London, was a well-known
maker of optical and mathematical instruments in the early decades
of the 18th century. He was particularly noted for the exact
division of scales, and examples of his work are to be found in the
major collections.</p>

<p>Dabney's name appeared again several years later, in the Supplement
to the <i>Boston Evening Post</i> for December 12, 1743, and
again in the <i>Boston Evening Post</i> for December 19 of the same year,
with the following advertisement:</p>

<blockquote><p>To be shown by John Dabney, Mathematical Instrument maker, in Milk
Street, Boston, on Monday, Tuesday and Thursday Evenings, from five to
eight o'clock, for the Entertainment of the Curious, the Magic Lanthorn
an Optick Machine, which exhibits a great Number of wonderful and surprising
Figures, prodigious large, and vivid, at Half a Crown each, Old Tenor.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<p>In New York City, one of the earliest immigrant instrument
makers was Charles Walpole, who established a shop at a corner in
Wall Street, according to a notice in the May 26, 1746, issue of the
<i>New York Evening Post</i>. The announcement stated that Walpole
was a "citizen of London" and that at his shop "all sorts of Mathematical
Instruments, whether in silver or brass, are made and
mended...."</p>

<p>In the May 21, 1753, issue of <i>The New York Gazette or The
Weekly Post Boy</i> there was an announcement by the widow of
Balthaser Sommer who lived on Pot-Baker's Hill in Smith Street
in New York City and who advertised herself as a "grinder of
all sorts of optic glasses, spying glasses, of all lengths, spectacles,
reading glasses for near-sighted people or others; also spying glasses
of 3 feet long which are to set on a common Walking-Cane and
yet be carried as a Pocket-Book."</p>

<p>John Benson emigrated from Birmingham, England, and established
a lapidary and optical store in May 1793 at 12 Princess
Street in New York, where he produced miniatures, lockets,
rings, glasses, "as well as Spectacles, single reading and burning
glasses, and where he also polished scratch'd glasses." In July 1797
he moved to 106 Pearl Street where he sold green goggles, thermometers,
and opera and spy glasses, in addition to an assortment of
jewelry. In September 1798 he was established at a new location,
147 Pearl Street, "At the sign of The Green Spectacles" where he
specialized in optical goods. He featured for rent or sale a "Portable
Camera Obscura" for the use of artists in drawing landscapes.
His advertisements chronicled each change in location in the issues
of <i>The New York Daily Advertiser</i>.</p>

<p>A craftsman whose name is well known in scientific circles was
Anthony Lamb, who advertised in 1753 as a mathematical instrument
maker living on Hunter's Key, New York. He claimed that
he could furnish</p>

<blockquote><p>Godfrey's newly invented quadrant, for taking the latitude or other altitudes
at sea; hydrometers for trying the exact strength of spirits, large surveying
instruments in a more curious manner than usual; which may be used in any
weather without exception, small ditto which may be fixed on the end of a
walking stick, and lengthened to a commodious height, gauging instruments
as now in use, according to an act of assembly with all other mathematical
instruments for sea or land, by wholesale or retail at reasonable rates.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Lamb had served an apprenticeship with Henry Carter, a
mathematical  instrument maker in  London. In July 1724 he
became an accomplice of Jack Sheppard, a notorious burglar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>, and
was arrested and sentenced to the gallows in 1724. As he was
awaiting execution on the gallows at Tyburn, his sentence was
commuted to transportation to Virginia for a period of seven
years, inasmuch as this was his first offence. After he had completed
his term of seven years in Virginia he moved to Philadelphia,
where he opened a shop as an instrument maker and a private
school for teaching technical subjects. The curriculum included
surveying, navigation, and mathematics. Although his enterprises
prospered, he moved to New York. There he married a
Miss Ham and established himself in a respectable position.
Lamb's first advertisement in New York appeared on January 23,
1749. He died on December 11, 1784, at the age of 81, and two
days later he was eulogized in <i>The New York Packet</i> where he was
mentioned as "a steady friend to the liberties of America."</p>

<p>John Lamb (1735-1800), Anthony's son, learned and practiced
his father's craft for a time and worked as a partner in the firm of
A. Lamb &amp; Son. He subsequently became a wine and sugar
merchant, achieved considerable wealth, married well, and was
accepted by the gentry of the city. He was a firm patriot and from
1765 he was active as the leader of the Sons of Liberty. He
served in several major engagements in the American Revolution
and in 1783 was brevetted a brigadier-general.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>
