'edited' flag after generating HTML.

## Version 1.0.18
Fixed removal of too many lines when moving
footnotes to landing zone.

## Version 1.0.17
Fixed error from hitting down arrow twice
after startup. Ignore tags in word frequency popup; ignore
away `*` characters (the way it used to be) except for `-*`
(not the way it used to be). Added spell check in multiple
languages to old menus and PP Wizard (actually done in 1.0.16).
Write setting.rc to guiguts home directory. Fixed problem
changing font sizes. Made check for two words (flash light
vs. flashlight vs. flash-light) optional.

## Version 1.0.16
Made Do All into a button rather than a checkbox.
Radiobuttons for menu structure selection. Fixed undefined
subroutine for Auto Save Interval and fontsize. Made choice of menus
a Radiobutton. Added warning for headers (`<h2>`) with four or more
lines through the invalid tag `<Warning: long header>`. Made
HTML labels and sorting language dependent with plugin files
for English (default) and Danish.

## Version 1.0.15.

Source Check to the Text Version(s) menu. Fixed undefined subroutine
error for hyperlinkpagenumbers. Handled headers of 3 or more lines.
Removed upper case for &amp; in author. Fixed problem with flood fill
popup. Fixed problem with Draw Boxes. Corrected space in replace string

handles all page separators in one pass, assuming the file has been
proofread and footnotes handled with no extra or missing blank lines.
Possible soft hyphens `-*` are not rejoined. Fixed highlighting of
quotes.

## Version 1.0.13
Fixed Replace All where the search term has a regexp
metacharacter such as '['. Made the "div" and "span" entries on the
HTML Fixup popup sticky. Marked PP Wizard as beta and not
the default menu structure.

## Version 1.0.12
Provided message when current version is up to date, reset
the update clock when a new version is run, and added a "Working" message
while it is checking. Remove extra line before footnote being moved.
Further fix to Search and Replace All undefined subroutine error and
a handful of similar errors.

## Version 1.0.11
Rejoin footnotes no longer leaves an extra new line
where the rejoined footnote used to be. Search and Replace All no
longer produces undefined subroutine error.

## Version 1.0.10
Page markers are centered in Adjust Page Marker dialog with
an option "Do No Center Page Markers". Fixed an error "Undefined subroutine
b2scroll".

## Version 1.0.9
After "Find Next ... Block" screen is centered on what is
found. Size/location of main window and font are sticky again (broken
after 1.0.5).

## Version 1.0.8
In HTML generation, fixed pileup of page numbers at a
thought break (a fix for this in an earlier version was lost). Improved
placement of closing markup for a block of footnotes.

## Version 1.0.7
Poetry converted to HTML has an indent of one em for
every two spaces. Conversion does not assume poetry is already rewrapped
so all lines begin with four spaces. If all lines are indented by four
spaces, then measure indentation relative to the four spaces. If some
lines are not indented by four spaces, measure indentation relative to
the beginning of the line. Check Footnotes popup is clickable to jump
to the footnote; the popup is destroyed if "First Pass" is selected.
Added File, Export to two formats (page separators, or page markup
like `<Pg23>`).

## Version 1.0.6
Fixed problem with scannos highlighting taking forever to
turn on; default scannos file en-common.txt is selected. Handle spaces in
gutcheck path (mentioned in #3434768). In guiguts.bat, put tools\perl
higher on the path than the existing path; fixed path for ENCFONTS used
by the Gnutenberg Press. Made highlighting of scannos sticky. Set default
path for gutcheck and jeebies on non-Windows systems. `<g>gesperrt text</g>`
is converted to `<em class="gesperrt">gesperrt text</em>`. Added second
alternative menu structure for comment. Altered Fixup 'thought break'
response. Updated Greek transliteration of punctuation.

## Version 1.0.5
Introduced a PP Wizard, an alternative menu structure,
that steps PPers through the GG checklist, which is not the default
option. Added a rudimentary check of whether HTML is "Epub friendly".
Changed `<p>` css in headerdefault.txt to work better on mobi devices:
margin-top: .51em; margin-bottom: .49em;. Reorganized the Preference
menu. Fixed bug with Gutcheck hanging on rerun. Added check for whether
the string entered in the RegExp field in the Word Frequency popup is a
valid regular expression. Added PP Process Checklist to Help menu.
Copied headerdefault.txt to header.txt on startup if header.txt does not
exist. Spellcheck no longer double counts occurrences of a word if run a
second time. Tidy Up Footnotes works if there is only one footnote.
Autogenerate HTML no longer uses `/*` or captions as the title. Auto Illus
Search no longer doubles tags in figleft and figright. Import Prep Text
allows letters in png filenames. Additional external operations added.
Search at beginning works again (broken in 1.0.4) but search will not
find the very first text in a file (fixed in 1.0.4). Problem with spaces
in gutcheck and other paths fixed.

## Version 1.0.4
Hyphen check now also checks for "flash light" not only
"flash-light", "flash--light", and "flashlight". A regular expression
search over line breaks now respects the ignore case flag. Fixed path
and extension so EpubMaker will take .html files as input. PPV TXT and
PP HTML labeled more accurately as pptxt and pphtml. Only README.TXT
appears in the prepopulated recently used file list. Search can find the
first word in the file. Word frequency rerun after typing words in empty
file reports now works and bug with unresponsive save as dialog fixed.
Guiguts.bat calls perl in a way that should (may) ignore preexisting
installations of perl.

## Version 1.0.3
Relocated HTML page number outside an open `<span>` eg for a line
of poetry so page numbers align vertically. Auto List on HTML palette no
longer removes spaces before markup in multiline mode. HTML anchors for
chapter headings are no longer empty but surround the chapter title
text. Join Lines removes `*/ /*` `</i>` `<i>` etc. markup only if it matches. Fixed
Undo button on Fix Page Separator popup and added Redo button. Fixed
Find Greek on the Fixup menu to find all [Greek: ] occurrences.
Unicode->beta no longer converts \x{1FA7} and certain other characters
into %{HASH(0x4f10ff8)}. Added beta code for Greek character stigma.
Fixed bug if user tries to highlight scannos using the scannos list in
the scannos directory rather than a word list in the word list
directory.

## Version 1.0.2
Fixed problem in which a regex replace with \G in the
found text led to characters being converted to Greek. Added message to
run final W3C markup validation at validator.w3.org. Improved conversion
of `<` and `>` characters when autogenerating HTML.

## Version 1.0.1
Revamped spell checker including in Word Frequency popup
to handle UTF-8. Fixed "wide character in print" error by running
utf8::encode. Improved regexp to search for orphaned markup per
RoryConnor. Cleared undo cache after HTML autogenerate. Set command to
open browser for non-Windows OS and use it for external operations.
Dictionary search on the external operations menu now passes the
selection as a search argument. Made ASCII Boxes popup resizable.
Removed trailing space on last line of `/# #/` block after rewrap. Respect
preference to leave space after end of line hyphen during rewrap if Join
Lines Keep Hyphen is chosen. Removed period on "Set margins for rewrap."
Changed "Check Errors" box to "Run Checks". Run fixup ignores /X X/ (as
well as `/* */` and `/$ $/`) blocks if the first option is checked. Fixed
ordering of page numbers anchored inside HTML `<h1>` or `<h2>` tags. Add gutcheck
and jeebies directories without the .exe files to the guiguts-n.n.n.zip
file.

## Version 1.0.0
Relative to version 0.2.10, the main changes in version 1.0 are

1. One click installation on Windows and Macintosh/OSX computers with no need
   to install perl separately (see guiguts-win and guiguts-mac zip files)
2. Several major new features, including running all HTML checks with one
   button, side by side viewing of text and images, and support for RST
   and PGTEI
3. Fixes to many long-standing bugs


### Major New Features

All the HTML checks can be run with a  single click, and the output is
clickable in most cases. Second, HTML and CSS  validation can now be done on
your own computer (and PGTEI as well) and there are checks for unused CSS and
image issues (using the pphtml and ppimage scripts). Third, there is now an
option to view text and images side-by-side without having to click on "See
Image" for each page. For instance you move forward or back one page for both
text and image with the "<" and ">" buttons on the status bar. Also, the Auto
Show Images option lets you see the image for instance for the page you are
spellchecking or for each search hit.

### Other New Features

A "View in Browser" and Hyperlink page numbers buttons on the HTML palette,
tearoff of the Unicode menu, listing small caps in the Word Frequency popup,
automatic checking for updates (which can be turned off), horizontal rules as
css, an option if nothing is found to return to the starting point, better
ability to find executables automatically, GutWrench scanno files are
included, a warning to use human readable filenames, option to include
goodwords in spellcheck project dictionary, a text processing menu to ease
conversion of bold/italics/small caps, the label Image #nnn in Configure Page
Labels is clickable, added Find Transliterations and Find Orphaned Markup
(before it only searched for unmatched brackets) to Search menu, Adjust Page
Markers menu is accessible from the File menu. Most popups now remember if
they have been moved or resized. Unless the user has previously set the size
of the main screen, it is maximized (nearly) on the first run. Added to Word
Frequency buttons to check for ligatures and for an arbitrary regular
expression. For developers, there are internal improvements, including partial
refactoring of functionality into perl  modules and a unit testing framework.

### Bug Fixes

Dash or periods in the proofer's name no longer messes up display of proofers
or removal of page separators. Fixed moving of page markers. The default for
word search from the Word Frequency menu is now "Whole Word". Unicode menu is
now broken into two pieces so it does not run off the screen where Mac users
cannot see it. Also, the Unicode popup has a pulldown list to change UTF
blocks. Replace All now replaces all and is a factor of 10 faster (but not for
regexes). Double click in Word Frequency does whole word search by default.
"--" on a line by itself gets converted to an emdash. Fixed regex editor for
scannos, Ctrl-S saves the file. There is a much higher likelihood that this
version generates valid HTML. Page anchors are no longer placed at the end of
the previous paragraph or before the horizontal rule. Fixed
misplacement/overlapping of HTML page numbers, superscripts are converted to
HTML correctly (Philad^a) without curly brackets. Fixed multiple page markers
at a single location so they do not  overlap but stack vertically like `[Pg
32]<br />[Pg 33]`. Fixed problem with  moving mark left (entry for initial page
number was blank) or up (code was  garbled). Fixed bugs with small caps
conversion; replace all with regex and $1 backreferences, stripping markup
from captions in HTML. Changing the pngs path saves the .bin file immediately.
Multi term searching is sticky even after guiguts is closed and reopened.
Search history keeps track of searches more reliably (but still does not
include scanno searches). Tk TextEdit's FindAndReplaceAll native function goes
into an endless loop if the search term is in the replacement term (replace
"C" with "CC". In such cases, guiguts now reverts to the old very slow method.
Fixed missing space before close of img tag. Gutcheck or HTML Autogenerate on
empty window produces a warning. Fixed Export as Prep Text which left the page
headers if the header did not have enough -'s at the end. In PP HTML, fixed
0:1 report for double blanks. Project dictionary not ignored on restart even
if longer than 8 characters. Reversed order of "Title" and "Caption" in HTML
image popup. Word frequency count is run before any spell check. Toolbar font
is no longer italic for readability. Default poetry left rewrap margin set to
4. Fixed case sensitivity of searches from Word Frequency Popup. Made "Stay on
Top"  preference apply to most popups except Word Frequency. Fixed double
click search on Word Frequency popup to work for strings with nonalphanumeric
characters (',-,--) while searching from Character Cnts does not do a whole
word search. Word search from Word Frequency popup works if the word contains
an apostrophe. Allow search from Word Frequency popup for expressions with
regex metacharacters such as `\`. Made default sort order for the word
frequency list sticky. Made choice of poetry left margin sticky. Made all top
level menus tearoff. More revisions to accommodate non-numeric page markers.
Fixed page numbers when pngs begin with a letter such as "a001.png". Leave out
alt and title tags from `<img ...>` if blank.

### Configuring Side-by-Side Viewing of Text and Images

The side by side image viewing works best if the window for the viewer is
sized to match the image (in XnView, choose View, Auto Image Size, Fit Image
to Window) and only one instance of the viewer is allowed to avoid having one
instance for every page viewed (in XnView, choose Tools, Options, General,
Only One Instance; in Irfanview Options -> Properties/Setting -> Start/Exit
Options, or Options -> Properties/Setting -> Misc.1 Check "Only 1 instance of
IrfanView is active). To page through images, use the "<" and ">" buttons on
the status bar. To Auto Show Page Images, use the "Auto Img" button on the
status bar, use the option on the Prefs menu, or checkboxes in the various
search/spellcheck dialogs.
