<head>INTRODUCTION.</head>

<p>Scepticism is as much the result of knowledge, as knowledge is of
scepticism. To be content with what we at present know, is, for the
most part, to shut our ears against conviction; since, from the very
gradual character of our education, we must continually forget, and
emancipate ourselves from, knowledge previously acquired; we must set
aside old notions and embrace fresh ones; and, as we learn, we must be
daily unlearning something which it has cost us no small labour and
anxiety to acquire.</p>

<p>And this difficulty attaches itself more closely to an age in which
progress has gained a strong ascendency over prejudice, and in which
persons and things are, day by day, finding their real level, in lieu
of their conventional value. The same principles which have swept away
traditional abuses, and which are making rapid havoc among the revenues
of sinecurists, and stripping the thin, tawdry veil from attractive
superstitions, are working as actively in literature as in society. The
credulity of one writer, or the partiality of another, finds as
powerful a touchstone and as wholesome a chastisement in the healthy
scepticism of a temperate class of antagonists, as the dreams of
conservatism, or the impostures of pluralist sinecures in the Church.
History and tradition, whether of ancient or comparatively recent
times, are subjected to very different handling from that which the
indulgence or credulity of former ages could allow. Mere statements are
jealously watched, and the motives of the writer form as important an
ingredient in the analysis of his history, as the facts he records.
Probability is a powerful and troublesome test; and it is by this
troublesome standard that a large portion of historical evidence is
sifted. Consistency is no less pertinacious and exacting in its
demands. In brief, to write a history, we must know more than mere
facts. Human nature, viewed under an induction of extended experience,
is the best help to the criticism of human history. Historical
characters can only be estimated by the standard which human
experience, whether actual or traditionary, has furnished. To form
correct views of individuals we must regard them as forming parts of a
great whole—we must measure them by their relation to the mass of
beings by whom they are surrounded, and, in contemplating the incidents
in their<pb n="x" /><anchor id="Pgx" /> lives or condition which tradition has handed down to us, we
must rather consider the general bearing of the whole narrative, than
the respective probability of its details.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate for us, that, of some of the greatest men, we know
least, and talk most. Homer, Socrates, and Shakespere<note place="foot"><p>"What," says Archdeacon Wilberforce, "is the natural root of loyalty as
distinguished from such mere selfish desire of personal security as is
apt to take its place in civilized times, but that consciousness of a
natural bond among the families of men which gives a fellow-feeling to
whole clans and nations, and thus enlists their affections in behalf of
those time-honoured representatives of their ancient blood, in whose
success they feel a personal interest? Hence the delight when we
recognize an act of nobility or justice in our hereditary princes</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"'Tuque prior, tu parce genus qui ducis Olympo,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Projice tela manu <hi rend="font-style: italic">sanguis meus</hi>'</l>
</lg>

<p>"So strong is this feeling, that it regains an engrafted influence even
when history witnesses that vast convulsions have rent and weakened it
and the Celtic feeling towards the Stuarts has been rekindled in our
own days towards the grand daughter of George the Third of Hanover.</p>

<p>"Somewhat similar may be seen in the disposition to idolize those great
lawgivers of man's race, who have given expression, in the immortal
language of song, to the deeper inspirations of our nature. The
thoughts of Homer or of Shakespere are the universal inheritance of the
human race. In this mutual ground every man meets his brother, they
have been bet forth by the providence of God to vindicate for all of us
what nature could effect, and that, in these representatives of our
race, we might recognize our common benefactors.'—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Doctrine of the
Incarnation,</hi> pp. 9, 10.</p></note> have, perhaps, contributed more to the
intellectual enlightenment of mankind than any other three writers who
could be named, and yet the history of all three has given rise to a
boundless ocean of discussion, which has left us little save the option
of choosing which theory or theories we will follow. The personality of
Shakespere is, perhaps, the only thing in which critics will allow us
to believe without controversy; but upon everything else, even down to
the authorship of plays, there is more or less of doubt and
uncertainty. Of Socrates we know as little as the contradictions of
Plato and Xenophon will allow us to know. He was one of the <hi rend="font-style: italic">dramatis
personae</hi> in two dramas as unlike in principles as in style. He
appears as the enunciator of opinions as different in their tone as
those of the writers who have handed them down. When we have read Plato
<hi rend="font-style: italic">or</hi> Xenophon, we think we know something of Socrates; when we
have fairly read and examined both, we feel convinced that we are
something worse than ignorant.</p>

<p>It has been an easy, and a popular expedient, of late years, to deny
the personal or real existence of men and things whose life and
condition were too much for our belief. This system—which has often
comforted the religious sceptic, and substituted the consolations of
Strauss for those of the New Testament—has been of incalculable value
to the historical theorists of the last and present centuries. To
question the existence of Alexander the Great, would be a more
excusable act, than to believe in that of Romulus. To deny a fact
related in Herodotus, because it is inconsistent with a theory
developed from an Assyrian inscription which no two scholars read in
the same way, is more pardonable, than to believe in the good-natured
old king whom the elegant pen of Florian has idealized—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Numa
Pompilius.</hi></p>

<p>Scepticism has attained its culminating point with respect to Homer,
and the state of our Homeric knowledge may be described as a free
permission to believe any theory, provided we throw overboard<pb n="xi" /><anchor id="Pgxi" /> all
written tradition, concerning the author or authors of the Iliad and
Odyssey. What few authorities exist on the subject, are summarily
dismissed, although the arguments appear to run in a circle. "This
cannot be true, because it is not true; and, that is not true, because
it cannot be true." Such seems to be the style, in which testimony upon
testimony, statement upon statement, is consigned to denial and
oblivion.</p>

<p>It is, however, unfortunate that the professed biographies of Homer are
partly forgeries, partly freaks of ingenuity and imagination, in which
truth is the requisite most wanting. Before taking a brief review of
the Homeric theory in its present conditions, some notice must be taken
of the treatise on the Life of Homer which has been attributed to
Herodotus.</p>

<p>According to this document, the city of Cumae in Æolia, was, at an
early period, the seat of frequent immigrations from various parts of
Greece. Among the immigrants was Menapolus, the son of Ithagenes.
Although poor, he married, and the result of the union was a girl named
Critheis. The girl was left an orphan at an early age, under the
guardianship of Cleanax, of Argos. It is to the indiscretion of this
maiden that we "are indebted for so much happiness." Homer was the
first fruit of her juvenile frailty, and received the name of
Melesigenes, from having been born near the river Meles, in Boeotia,
whither Critheis had been transported in order to save her reputation.</p>

<p>"At this time," continues our narrative, "there lived at Smyrna a man
named Phemius, a teacher of literature and music, who, not being
married, engaged Critheis to manage his household, and spin the flax he
received as the price of his scholastic labours. So satisfactory was
her performance of this task, and so modest her conduct, that he made
proposals of marriage, declaring himself, as a further inducement,
willing to adopt her son, who, he asserted, would become a clever man,
if he were carefully brought up."</p>

<p>They were married; careful cultivation ripened the talents which nature
had bestowed, and Melesigenes soon surpassed his schoolfellows in every
attainment, and, when older, rivalled his preceptor in wisdom. Phemius
died, leaving him sole heir to his property, and his mother soon
followed. Melesigenes carried on his adopted father's school with great
success, exciting the admiration not only of the inhabitants of Smyrna,
but also of the strangers whom the trade carried on there, especially
in the exportation of corn, attracted to that city. Among these
visitors, one Mentes, from Leucadia, the modern Santa Maura, who
evinced a knowledge and intelligence rarely found in those times,
persuaded Melesigenes to close his school, and accompany him on his
travels. He promised not only to pay his expenses, but to furnish him
with a further stipend, urging, that, "While he was yet young, it was
fitting that he should see with his own eyes the countries and cities
which might hereafter be the subjects of his discourses." Melesigenes
consented, and set out with his patron, "examining all the curiosities
of the countries they visited, and informing himself of everything by
interrogating those whom he met." We may also suppose, that he<pb n="xii" /><anchor id="Pgxii" /> wrote
memoirs of all that he deemed worthy of preservation<note place="foot"><p>Eikos
de min aen kai mnaemoruna panton grapherthai. Vit. Hom. in Schweigh
Herodot t. iv. p. 299, sq. Section 6. I may observe that this Life has
been paraphrased in English by my learned young friend Kenneth R. H.
Mackenzie, and appended to my prose translation of the Odyssey. The
present abridgement however, will contain all that is of use to the
reader, for the biographical value of the treatise is most
insignificant.</p></note> Having set sail from Tyrrhenia and Iberia, they reached
Ithaca. Here Melesigenes, who had already suffered in his eyes, became
much worse, and Mentes, who was about to leave for Leucadia, left him
to the medical superintendence of a friend of his, named Mentor, the
son of Alcinor. Under his hospitable and intelligent host, Melesigenes
rapidly became acquainted with the legends respecting Ulysses, which
afterwards formed the subject of the Odyssey. The inhabitants of Ithaca
assert, that it was here that Melesigenes became blind, but the
Colophomans make their city the seat of that misfortune. He then
returned to Smyrna, where he applied himself to the study of poetry.<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">I.e.</hi> both of composing and reciting verses for as Blair
observes, "The first poets sang their own verses." Sextus Empir.
adv. Mus. p. 360 ed. Fabric. Ou hamelei ge toi kai oi poiaetai
melopoioi legontai, kai ta Omaerou epae to palai pros lyran aedeto.</p>

<p>"The voice," observes Heeren, "was always accompanied by some
instrument. The bard was provided with a harp on which he played a
prelude, to elevate and inspire his mind, and with which he accompanied
the song when begun. His voice probably preserved a medium between
singing and recitation; the words, and not the melody were regarded by
the listeners, hence it was necessary for him to remain intelligible to
all. In countries where nothing similar is found, it is difficult to
represent such scenes to the mind; but whoever has had an opportunity
of listening to the improvisation of Italy, can easily form an idea of
Demodocus and Phemius."—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Ancient Greece,</hi> p. 94.</p></note></p>

<p>But poverty soon drove him to Cumae. Having passed over the Hermaean
plain, he arrived at Neon Teichos, the New Wall, a colony of Cumae.
Here his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of
one Tychias, an armourer. "And up to my time," continued the author,
"the inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a
recitation of his verses, and they greatly honoured the spot. Here also
a poplar grew, which they said had sprung up ever since Melesigenes
arrived".<note place="foot"><p>"Should it not be, since <hi rend="font-style: italic">my</hi> arrival? asks
Mackenzie, observing that "poplars can hardly live so long".  But
setting aside the fact that we must not expect consistency in a mere
romance, the ancients had a superstitious belief in the great age of
trees which grew near places consecrated by the presence of gods and
great men. See Cicero de Legg II I, sub init., where he speaks of the
plane tree under which Socrates used to walk and of the tree at Delos,
where Latona gave birth to Apollo. This passage is referred to by
Stephanus of Byzantium, <hi rend="font-style: italic">s. v.</hi> N. T. p. 490, ed. de Pinedo. I
omit quoting any of the dull epigrams ascribed to Homer for, as Mr.
Justice Talfourd rightly observes, "The authenticity of these fragments
depends upon that of the pseudo Herodotean Life of Homer, from which
they are taken." Lit of Greece, pp. 38 in Encycl. Metrop. Cf.
Coleridge, Classic Poets, p. 317.</p></note></p>

<p>But poverty still drove him on, and he went by way of Larissa, as being
the most convenient road. Here, the Cumans say, he composed an epitaph
on Gordius, king of Phrygia, which has however, and with greater
probability, been attributed to Cleobulus of Lindus.<note place="foot"><p>It is
quoted as the work of Cleobulus, by Diogenes Laert. Vit. Cleob. p. 62,
ed. Casaub.</p></note></p>

<p>Arrived at Cumae, he frequented the <hi rend="font-style: italic">converzationes</hi><note place="foot"><p>I
trust I am justified in employing this as an equivalent for the Greek
leschai.</p></note> of the old men, and delighted all by the charms of his
poetry. Encouraged by this favourable reception, he declared that, if
they would allow him a public maintenance, he would render their city
most gloriously  renowned.<pb n="xiii" /><anchor id="Pgxiii" /> They avowed their willingness to support him
in the measure he proposed, and procured him an audience in the
council. Having made the speech, with the purport of which our author
has forgotten to acquaint us, he retired, and left them to debate
respecting the answer to be given to his proposal.</p>

<p>The greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poet's
demand, but one man observed that "if they were to feed <hi rend="font-style: italic">Homers,</hi>
they would be encumbered with a multitude of useless people." "From
this circumstance," says the writer, "Melesigenes acquired the name of
Homer, for the Cumans call blind men <hi rend="font-style: italic">Homers.</hi>"<note place="foot"><p>Os ei

Vit. Hom. <hi rend="font-style: italic">l. c.</hi> p. 311. The etymology has been condemned by
recent scholars. See Welcker, Epische Cyclus, p. 127, and Mackenzie's
note, p. xiv.</p></note> With a love of economy, which shows how similar the
world has always been in its treatment of literary men, the pension was
denied, and the poet vented his disappointment in a wish that Cumoea
might never produce a poet capable of giving it renown and glory.</p>

<p>At Phocoea, Homer was destined to experience another literary distress.
One Thestorides, who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius, kept
Homer in his own house, and allowed him a pittance, on condition of the
verses of the poet passing in his name. Having collected sufficient
poetry to be profitable, Thestorides, like some would-be-literary
publishers, neglected the man whose brains he had sucked, and left him.
At his departure, Homer is said to have observed: "O Thestorides, of
the many things hidden from the knowledge of man, nothing is more
unintelligible than the human heart."<note place="foot"><p>Thestorides,
thnetoisin anoiston poleon per, ouden aphrastoteron peletai noou
anthropoisin. Ibid. p. 315. During his stay at Phocoea, Homer is said
to have composed the Little Iliad, and the Phocoeid. See Muller's Hist.
of Lit., vi. Section 3. Welcker, <hi rend="font-style: italic">l. c.</hi> pp. 132, 272, 358, sqq.,
and Mure, Gr. Lit. vol. ii. p. 284, sq.</p></note></p>

<p>Homer continued his career of difficulty and distress, until some Chian
merchants, struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him
recite, acquainted him with the fact that Thestorides was pursuing a
profitable livelihood by the recital of the very same poems. This at
once determined him to set out for Chios. No vessel happened then to be
setting sail thither, but he found one ready to Start for Erythrae, a
town of Ionia, which faces that island, and he prevailed upon the
seamen to allow him to accompany them. Having embarked, he invoked a
favourable wind, and prayed that he might be able to expose the
imposture of Thestorides, who, by his breach of hospitality, had drawn
down the wrath of Jove the Hospitable.</p>

<p>At Erythrae, Homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in
Phocoea, by whose assistance he at length, after some difficulty,
reached the little hamlet of Pithys. Here he met with an adventure,
which we will continue in the words of our author. "Having set out from
Pithys, Homer went on, attracted by the cries of some goats that were
pasturing. The dogs barked on his approach, and he cried out. Glaucus
(for that was the name of the goat-herd) heard his voice, ran up
quickly, called off his dogs, and drove them away from Homer. For or
some time he stood wondering how a blind man should have<pb n="xiv" /><anchor id="Pgxiv" /> reached such a
place alone, and what could be his design in coming. He then went up to
him, and inquired who he was, and how he had come to desolate places
and untrodden spots, and of what he stood in need. Homer, by recounting
to him the whole history of his misfortunes, moved him with compassion;
and he took him, and led him to his cot, and having lit a fire, bade
him sup.<note place="foot"><p>This is so pretty a picture of early manners and
hospitality, that it is almost a pity to find that it is obviously a
copy from the Odyssey. See the fourteenth book. In fact, whoever was
the author of this fictitious biography, he showed some tact in
identifying Homer with certain events described in his poems, and in
eliciting from them the germs of something like a personal narrative.</p></note></p>

<p>"The dogs, instead of eating, kept barking at the stranger, according
to their usual habit. Whereupon Homer addressed Glaucus thus: O
Glaucus, my friend, prythee attend to my behest. First give the dogs
their supper at the doors of the hut: for so it is better, since,
whilst they watch, nor thief nor wild beast will approach the fold.</p>

<p>Glaucus was pleased with the advice, and marvelled at its author.
Having finished supper, they banqueted<note place="foot"><p>Dia logon estionto. A
common metaphor. So Plato calls the parties conversing daitumones, or

conversation, Homer narrating his wanderings, and telling of the cities
he had visited.</p>

<p>At length they retired to rest; but on the following morning, Glaucus
resolved to go to his master, and acquaint him with his meeting with
Homer. Having left the goats in charge of a fellow-servant, he left
Homer at home, promising to return quickly. Having arrived at Bolissus,
a place near the farm, and finding his mate, he told him the whole
story respecting Homer and his journey. He paid little attention to
what he said, and blamed Glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and
feeding maimed and enfeebled persons. However, he bade him bring the
stranger to him.</p>

<p>Glaucus told Homer what had taken place, and bade him follow him,
assuring him that good fortune would be the result. Conversation soon
showed that the stranger was a man of much cleverness and general
knowledge, and the Chian persuaded him to remain, and to undertake the
charge of his children.<note place="foot"><p>It was at Bolissus, and in the house
of this Chian citizen, that Homer is said to have written the
Batrachomyomachia, or Battle of the Frogs and Mice, the Epicichlidia,
and some other minor works.</p></note></p>

<p>Besides the satisfaction of driving the impostor Thestorides from the
island, Homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher. In the town of
Chios he established a school where he taught the precepts of poetry.
"To this day," says Chandler,<note place="foot"><p>Chandler, Travels,  vol. i. p.
61, referred to in the Voyage Pittoresque dans la Grece, vol. i. P. 92,
where a view of the spot is given of which the author candidly says,—
"Je ne puis repondre d'une exactitude scrupuleuse dans la vue generale
que j'en donne, car etant alle seul pour l'examiner je perdis mon
crayon, et je fus oblige de m'en fier a ma memoire. Je ne crois
cependant pas avoir trop a me plaindre d'elle en cette occasion."</p></note> "the
most curious remain is that which has been named, without reason, the
School of Homer. It is on the coast, at some distance from the city,
northward, and appears to have been an open temple of Cybele, formed on
the top of a rock. The shape is oval, and in the centre is the image of
the goddess, the<pb n="xv" /><anchor id="Pgxv" /> head and an arm wanting. She is represented, as usual,
sitting. The chair has a lion carved on each side, and on the back. The
area is bounded by a low rim, or seat, and about five yards over. The
whole is hewn out of the mountain, is rude, indistinct, and probably of
the most remote antiquity."</p>

<p>So successful was this school, that Homer realised a considerable
fortune. He married, and had two daughters, one of whom died single,
the other married a Chian.</p>

<p>The following passage betrays the same tendency to connect the
personages of the poems with the history of the poet, which has already
been mentioned:—</p>

<p>"In his poetical compositions Homer displays great gratitude towards
Mentor of Ithaca, in the Odyssey, whose name he has inserted in his
poem as the companion of Ulysses,<note place="foot"><p>A more probable reason for

singing the Eiresione at the New Moon festivals, he earned a
subsistence, visiting the houses of the rich, with whose children he
was very popular.</p>

<p>In the spring he sailed for Athens, and arrived at the island of Ios,

<p>Such is, in brief, the substance of the earliest life of Homer we
possess, and so broad are the evidences of its historical
worthlessness, that it is scarcely necessary to point them out in
detail. Let us now consider some of the opinions to which a
persevering, patient, and learned—but by no means consistent—series
of investigations has led. In doing so, I profess to bring forward
statements, not to vouch for their reasonableness or probability.</p>

<p>"Homer appeared. The history of this poet and his works is lost in
doubtful obscurity, as is the history of many of the first minds who
have done honour to humanity, because they rose amidst darkness. The
majestic stream of his song, blessing and fertilizing, flows like the
Nile, through many lands and nations; and, like the sources of the
Nile, its fountains will ever remain concealed."</p>

<pb n="xvi" /><anchor id="Pgxvi" />

<p>Such are the words in which one of the most judicious German critics
has eloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of the
Homeric question is involved. With no less truth and feeling he
proceeds:—</p>

<p>"It seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature of
things makes possible. If the period of tradition in history is the
region of twilight, we should not expect in it perfect light. The
creations of genius always seem like miracles, because they are, for
the most part, created far out of the reach of observation. If we were
in possession of all the historical testimonies, we never could wholly
explain the origin of the Iliad and the Odyssey; for their origin, in
all essential points, must have remained the secret of the poet."
<note place="foot"><p>Heeren's Ancient Greece, p. 96.</p></note></p>

<p>From this criticism, which shows as much insight into the depths of
human nature as into the minute wire-drawings of scholastic
investigation, let us pass on to the main question at issue. Was Homer
an individual?<note place="foot"><p>Compare Sir E. L. Bulwer's Caxtons v. i. p.
4.</p></note> or were the Iliad and Odyssey the result of an ingenious
arrangement of fragments by earlier poets?</p>

<p>Well has Landor remarked: "Some tell us there were twenty Homers; some
deny that there was ever one. It were idle and foolish to shake the
contents of a vase, in order to let them settle at last. We are
perpetually labouring to destroy our delights, our composure, our
devotion to superior power. Of all the animals on earth we least know
what is good for us. My opinion is, that what is best for us is our
admiration of good. No man living venerates Homer more than I do."
<note place="foot"><p>Pericles and Aspasia, Letter lxxxiv., Works, vol ii. p.
387.</p></note></p>

<p>But, greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests contented
with the poetry on which its best impulses had been nurtured and
fostered, without seeking to destroy the vividness of first impressions
by minute analysis—our editorial office compels us to give some
attention to the doubts and difficulties with which the Homeric
question is beset, and to entreat our reader, for a brief period, to
prefer his judgment to his imagination, and to condescend to dry
details.</p>

<p>Before, however, entering into particulars respecting the question of
this unity of the Homeric poems, (at least of the Iliad,) I must
express my sympathy with the sentiments expressed in the following
remarks:—</p>

<p>"We cannot but think the universal admiration of its unity by the
better, the poetic age of Greece, almost conclusive testimony to its
original composition. It was not till the age of the grammarians that
its primitive integrity was called in question; nor is it injustice to
assert, that the minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is not
the best qualification for the profound feeling, the comprehensive
conception of an harmonious whole. The most exquisite anatomist may be
no judge of the symmetry of the human frame: and we would take the
opinion of Chantrey or Westmacott on the proportions and general beauty
of a form, rather than that of Mr. Brodie or Sir Astley Cooper.</p>

His own views are moderate, and perhaps as satisfactory, on the whole,
as any of the hypotheses hitherto put forth. In fact, they consist in
an attempt to blend those hypotheses into something like consistency,
rather than in advocating any individual theory.</p></note> it would be tedious
to detail, no suspicion of the personal non-existence of Homer ever
arose. So far, the voice of antiquity seems to be in favour of our
early ideas on the subject; let us now see what are the discoveries to
which more modern investigations lay claim.</p>

<p>At the end of the seventeenth century, doubts had begun to awaken on
the subject, and we find Bentley remarking that "Homer wrote a sequel
of songs and rhapsodies, to be sung by himself, for small comings and
good cheer, at festivals and other days of merriment. These loose songs
were not collected together, in the form of an epic poem, till about
Peisistratus' time, about five hundred years after."<note place="foot"><p>Letters
to Phileleuth; Lips.</p></note></p>

<p>Two French writers—Hedelin and Perrault—avowed a similar scepticism
on the subject; but it is in the "Scienza Nuova" of Battista Vico, that
we first meet with the germ of the theory, subsequently defended by
Wolf with so much learning and acuteness. Indeed, it is with the
Wolfian theory that we have chiefly to deal, and with the following
bold hypothesis, which we will detail in the words of Grote<note place="foot"><p>Hist. of Greece, vol. ii. p. 191, sqq.</p></note>—</p>

<p>"Half a century ago, the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F. A. Wolf,
turning to account the Venetian Scholia, which had then been<pb n="xviii" /><anchor id="Pgxviii" /> recently
published, first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of
the Homeric text. A considerable part of that dissertation (though by
no means the whole) is employed in vindicating the position, previously
announced by Bentley, amongst others, that the separate constituent
portions of the Iliad and Odyssey had not been cemented together into
any compact body and unchangeable order, until the days of
Peisistratus, in the sixth century before Christ. As a step towards
that conclusion, Wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem
could be shown to have existed during the earlier times, to which their
composition is referred; and that without writing, neither the perfect
symmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived
by any poet, nor, if realized by him, transmitted with assurance to
posterity. The absence of easy and convenient writing, such as must be
indispensably supposed for long manuscripts, among the early Greeks,
was thus one of the points in Wolf's case against the primitive
integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey. By Nitzsch, and other leading
opponents of Wolf, the connection of the one with the other seems to
have been accepted as he originally put it; and it has been considered
incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the
Iliad and Odyssey, to maintain that they were written poems from the
beginning.</p>

<p>"To me it appears, that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf to
Peisistratus and his associates, in reference to the Homeric poems, are
nowise admissible. But much would undoubtedly be gained towards that
view of the question, if it could be shown, that, in order to
controvert it, we were driven to the necessity of admitting long
written poems, in the ninth century before the Christian aera. Few
things, in my opinion, can be more improbable; and Mr. Payne Knight,
opposed as he is to the Wolfian hypothesis, admits this no less than
Wolf himself. The traces of writing in Greece, even in the seventh
century before the Christian aera, are exceedingly trifling. We have no
remaining inscription earlier than the fortieth Olympiad, and the early
inscriptions are rude and unskilfully executed; nor can we even assure
ourselves whether Archilochus, Simonides of Amorgus, Kallinus,
Tyrtaeus, Xanthus, and the other early elegiac and lyric poets,
committed their compositions to writing, or at what time the practice
of doing so became familiar. The first positive ground which authorizes
us to presume the existence of a manuscript of Homer, is in the famous
ordinance of Solon, with regard to the rhapsodies at the Panathenaea:
but for what length of time previously manuscripts had existed, we are
unable to say.</p>

<p>"Those who maintain the Homeric poems to have been written from the
beginning, rest their case, not upon positive proofs, nor yet upon the
existing habits of society with regard to poetry—for they admit
generally that the Iliad and Odyssey were not read, but recited and
heard,—but upon the supposed necessity that there must have been
manuscripts to ensure the preservation of the poems—the unassisted
memory of reciters being neither sufficient nor trustworthy. But here
we only escape a smaller difficulty by running into a greater; for the
existence of trained bards, gifted with extraordinary memory,<pb n="xix" /><anchor id="Pgxix" />
<note place="foot"><p>It is, indeed not easy to calculate the height to which the
memory may be cultivated. To take an ordinary case, we might refer to
that of any first rate actor, who must be prepared, at a very short
warning, to 'rhapsodize,' night after night, parts which when laid
together, would amount to an immense number of lines. But all this is
nothing to two instances of our own day. Visiting at Naples a gentleman
of the highest intellectual attainments, and who held a distinguished
rank among the men of letters in the last century, he informed us that
the day before he had passed much time in examining a man, not highly
educated, who had learned to repeat the whole Gierusalemme of Tasso,
not only to recite it consecutively, but also to repeat those stanzas
in utter defiance of the sense, either forwards or backwards, or from
the eighth line to the first, alternately the odd and even lines—in
short, whatever the passage required; the memory, which seemed to cling
to the words much more than to the sense, had it at such perfect
command, that it could produce it under any form. Our informant went on
to state that this singular being was proceeding to learn the Orlando
Furioso in the same manner. But even this instance is less wonderful
than one as to which we may appeal to any of our readers that happened
some twenty years ago to visit the town of Stirling, in Scotland. No
such person can have forgotten the poor, uneducated man Blind Jamie who
could actually repeat, after a few minutes consideration any verse
required from any part of the Bible—even the obscurest and most
unimportant enumeration of mere proper names not excepted. We do not
mention these facts as touching the more difficult part of the question
before us, but facts they are; and if we find so much difficulty in
calculating the extent to which the mere memory may be cultivated, are
we, in these days of multifarious reading, and of countless distracting
affairs, fair judges of the perfection to which the invention and the
memory combined may attain in a simpler age, and among a more single
minded people?—Quarterly Review, <hi rend="font-style: italic">l. c.,</hi> p. 143, sqq.</p>

<p>Heeren steers between the two opinions, observing that, "The
Dschungariade of the Calmucks is said to surpass the poems of Homer in
length, as much as it stands beneath them in merit, and yet it exists
only in the memory of a people which is not unacquainted with writing.
But the songs of a nation are probably the last things which are
committed to writing, for the very reason that they are remembered."—
<hi rend="font-style: italic">Ancient Greece.</hi> p. 100.</p></note> is far less astonishing than that of
long manuscripts, in an age essentially non-reading and non-writing,
and when even suitable instruments and materials for the process are
not obvious. Moreover, there is a strong positive reason for believing
that the bard was under no necessity of refreshing his memory by
consulting a manuscript; for if such had been the fact, blindness would
have been a disqualification for the profession, which we know that it
was not, as well from the example of Demodokus, in the Odyssey, as from
that of the blind bard of Chios, in the Hymn to the Delian Apollo, whom
Thucydides, as well as the general tenor of Grecian legend, identifies
with Homer himself. The author of that hymn, be he who he may, could
never have described a blind man as attaining the utmost perfection in
his art, if he had been conscious that the memory of the bard was only
maintained by constant reference to the manuscript in his chest."</p>

<p>The loss of the digamma, that <hi rend="font-style: italic">crux</hi> of critics, that quicksand
upon which even the acumen of Bentley was shipwrecked, seems to prove
beyond a doubt, that the pronunciation of the Greek language had
undergone a considerable change. Now it is certainly difficult to
suppose that the Homeric poems could have suffered by this change, had
written copies been preserved. If Chaucer's poetry, for instance, had
not been written, it could only have come down to us in a softened
form, more like the effeminate version of Dryden, than the rough,
quaint, noble original.</p>

<p>"At what period," continues Grote, "these poems, or indeed any other
Greek poems, first began to be written, must be matter of conjecture,
though there is ground for assurance that it was before the time of
Solon. If, in the absence of evidence, we may venture upon<pb n="xx" /><anchor id="Pgxx" /> naming any
more determinate period, the question a once suggests itself, What were
the purposes which, in that state of society, a manuscript at its first
commencement must have been intended to answer? For whom was a written
Iliad necessary? Not for the rhapsodes; for with them it was not only
planted in the memory, but also interwoven with the feelings, and
conceived in conjunction with all those flexions and intonations of
voice, pauses, and other oral artifices which were required for
emphatic delivery, and which the naked manuscript could never
reproduce. Not for the general public—they were accustomed to receive
it with its rhapsodic delivery, and with its accompaniments of a solemn
and crowded festival. The only persons for whom the written Iliad would
be suitable would be a select few; studious and curious men; a class of
readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had
experienced as hearers in the crowd, and who would, on perusing the
written words, realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the
impression communicated by the reciter. Incredible as the statement may
seem in an age like the present, there is in all early societies, and
there was in early Greece, a time when no such reading class existed.
If we could discover at what time such a class first began to be
formed, we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic
poems were first committed to writing. Now the period which may with
the greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the
formation even of the narrowest reading class in Greece, is the middle
of the seventh century before the Christian aera (B.C. 660 to B.C.
630), the age of Terpander, Kallinus, Archilochus, Simonides of
Amorgus, &amp;c. I ground this supposition on the change then operated in
the character and tendencies of Grecian poetry and music—the elegiac
and the iambic measures having been introduced as rivals to the
primitive hexameter, and poetical compositions having been transferred
from the epical past to the affairs of present and real life. Such a
change was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of
publication (to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable, yet the
nearest approaching to the sense). It argued a new way of looking at
the old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new
poetical effect; and the men who stood forward in it, may well be
considered as desirous to study, and competent to criticize, from their
own individual point of view, the written words of the Homeric
rhapsodies, just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and
eulogized the Thebais as the production of Homer. There seems,
therefore, ground for conjecturing that (for the use of this newly-formed
and important, but very narrow class), manuscripts of the
Homeric poems and other old epics,—the Thebais and the Cypria, as well
as the Iliad and the Odyssey,—began to be compiled towards the middle
of the seventh century (B.C. 1); and the opening of Egypt to Grecian
commerce, which took place about the same period, would furnish
increased facilities for obtaining the requisite papyrus to write upon.
A reading class, when once formed, would doubtless slowly increase, and
the number of manuscripts along with it; so that before the time of
Solon, fifty years afterwards, both readers and manuscripts, though
still comparatively few, might have attained a<pb n="xxi" /><anchor id="Pgxxi" /> certain recognized
authority, and formed a tribunal of reference against the carelessness
of individual rhapsodes."<note place="foot"><p>Vol. II p. 198, sqq.</p></note></p>

<p>But even Peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession of
the credit, and we cannot help feeling the force of the following
observations—</p>

<quote rend="display">
<p>"There are several incidental circumstances which, in our opinion,
throw some suspicion over the whole history of the Peisistratid
compilation, at least over the theory, that the Iliad was cast into its
present stately and harmonious form by the directions of the Athenian
ruler. If the great poets, who flourished at the bright period of
Grecian song, of which, alas! we have inherited little more than the
fame, and the faint echo, if Stesichorus, Anacreon, and Simonides were
employed in the noble task of compiling the Iliad and Odyssey, so much
must have been done to arrange, to connect, to harmonize, that it is
almost incredible, that stronger marks of Athenian manufacture should
not remain. Whatever occasional anomalies may be detected, anomalies
which no doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the
Homeric age, however the irregular use of the digamma may have
perplexed our Bentleys, to whom the name of Helen is said to have
caused as much disquiet and distress as the fair one herself among the
heroes of her age, however Mr. Knight may have failed in reducing the
Homeric language to its primitive form; however, finally, the Attic
dialect may not have assumed all its more marked and distinguishing
characteristics—still it is difficult to suppose that the language,
particularly in the joinings and transitions, and connecting parts,
should not more clearly betray the incongruity between the more ancient
and modern forms of expression. It is not quite in character with such
a period to imitate an antique style, in order to piece out an
imperfect poem in the character of the original, as Sir Walter Scott
has done in his continuation of Sir Tristram.</p>

<p>"If, however, not even such faint and indistinct traces of Athenian
compilation are discoverable in the language of the poems, the total
absence of Athenian national feeling is perhaps no less worthy of
observation. In later, and it may fairly be suspected in earlier times,
the Athenians were more than ordinarily jealous of the fame of their
ancestors. But, amid all the traditions of the glories of early Greece
embodied in the Iliad, the Athenians play a most subordinate and
insignificant part. Even the few passages which relate to their
ancestors, Mr. Knight suspects to be interpolations. It is possible,
indeed, that in its leading outline, the Iliad may be true to historic
fact, that in the great maritime expedition of western Greece against
the rival and half-kindred empire of the Laomedontiadae, the chieftain
of Thessaly, from his valour and the number of his forces, may have
been the most important ally of the Peloponnesian sovereign; the preeminent
value of the ancient poetry on the Trojan war may thus have
forced the national feeling of the Athenians to yield to their taste.
The songs which spoke of their own great ancestor were, no doubt, of
far inferior sublimity and popularity, or, at first sight, a Theseid
would have been much more likely to have emanated from an Athenian
synod of compilers of<pb n="xxii" /><anchor id="Pgxxii" /> ancient song, than an Achilleid or an Olysseid.
Could France have given birth to a Tasso, Tancred would have been the
hero of the Jerusalem. If, however, the Homeric ballads, as they are
sometimes called, which related the wrath of Achilles, with all its
direful consequences, were so far superior to the rest of the poetic
cycle, as to admit no rivalry,—it is still surprising, that throughout
the whole poem the <hi rend="font-style: italic">callida junctura</hi> should never betray the
workmanship of an Athenian hand, and that the national spirit of a
race, who have at a later period not inaptly been compared to our self
admiring neighbours, the French, should submit with lofty self denial
to the almost total exclusion of their own ancestors—or, at least, to
the questionable dignity of only having produced a leader tolerably
skilled in the military tactics of his age."<note place="foot"><p>Quarterly
Review, <hi rend="font-style: italic">l. c.,</hi> p. 131 sq.</p></note></p>
</quote>

<p>To return to the Wolfian theory. While it is to be confessed, that
Wolf's objections to the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey
have never been wholly got over, we cannot help discovering that they
have failed to enlighten us as to any substantial point, and that the
difficulties with which the whole subject is beset, are rather
augmented than otherwise, if we admit his hypothesis. Nor is Lachmann's<note place="foot"><p>Betrachtungen uber die Ilias. Berol. 1841. See Grote, p.
204. Notes and Queries, vol. v. p. 221.</p></note> modification of his theory
any better. He divides the first twenty-two books of the Iliad into
sixteen different songs, and treats as ridiculous the belief that their
amalgamation into one regular poem belongs to a period earlier than the
age of Peisistratus. This, as Grote observes, "explains the gaps and
contradictions in the narrative, but it explains nothing else."
Moreover, we find no contradictions warranting this belief, and the so-called
sixteen poets concur in getting rid of the following leading men
in the first battle after the secession of Achilles: Elphenor, chief of
the Euboeans; Tlepolemus, of the Rhodians; Pandarus, of the Lycians;
Odius, of the Halizonians; Pirous and Acamas, of the Thracians. None of
these heroes again make their appearance, and we can but agree with
Colonel Mure, that "it seems strange that any number of independent
poets should have so harmoniously dispensed with the services of all
six in the sequel." The discrepancy, by which Pylaemenes, who is
represented as dead in the fifth book, weeps at his son's funeral in
the thirteenth, can only be regarded as the result of an interpolation.</p>

<p>Grote, although not very distinct in stating his own opinions on the
subject, has done much to clearly show the incongruity of the Wolfian
theory, and of Lachmann's modifications with the character of
Peisistratus. But he has also shown, and we think with equal success,
that the two questions relative to the primitive unity of these poems,
or, supposing that impossible, the unison of these parts by
Peisistratus, and not before his time, are essentially distinct. In
short, "a man may believe the Iliad to have been put together out of
pre-existing songs, without recognising the age of Peisistratus as the
period of its first compilation." The friends or literary
<hi rend="font-style: italic">employes</hi> of Peisistratus must have found an Iliad that was
already ancient, and the silence of the Alexandrine critics respecting
the Peisistratic "recension," goes far<pb n="xxiii" /><anchor id="Pgxxiii" /> to prove, that, among the
numerous manuscripts they examined, this was either wanting, or thought
unworthy of attention.</p>

<p>"Moreover," he continues, "the whole tenor of the poems themselves
confirms what is here remarked. There is nothing, either in the Iliad
or Odyssey, which savours of modernism, applying that term to the age
of Peisistratus—nothing which brings to our view the alterations
brought about by two centuries, in the Greek language, the coined
money, the habits of writing and reading, the despotisms and republican
governments, the close military array, the improved construction of
ships, the Amphiktyonic convocations, the mutual frequentation of
religious festivals, the Oriental and Egyptian veins of religion, &amp;c.,
familiar to the latter epoch. These alterations Onomakritus, and the
other literary friends of Peisistratus, could hardly have failed to
notice, even without design, had they then, for the first time,
undertaken the task of piecing together many self existent epics into
one large aggregate. Everything in the two great Homeric poems, both in
substance and in language, belongs to an age two or three centuries
earlier than Peisistratus. Indeed, even the interpolations (or those
passages which, on the best grounds, are pronounced to be such) betray
no trace of the sixth century before Christ, and may well have been
heard by Archilochus and Kallinus—in some cases even by Arktinus and
Hesiod—as genuine Homeric matter<note place="foot"><p>Prolegg. pp. xxxii.,
xxxvi., &amp;c.</p></note> As far as the evidences on the case, as well internal as
external, enable us to judge, we seem warranted in believing that the
Iliad and Odyssey were recited substantially as they now stand (always
allowing for paitial divergences of text and interpolations) in 776
B.C., our first trustworthy mark of Grecian time; and this ancient
date, let it be added, as it is the best-authenticated fact, so it is
also the most important attribute of the Homeric poems, considered in
reference to Grecian history; for they thus afford us an insight into
the anti-historical character of the Greeks, enabling us to trace the
subsequent forward march of the nation, and to seize instructive
contrasts between their former and their later condition."<note place="foot"><p>Vol. ii. p. 214 sqq.</p></note></p>

<p>On the whole, I am inclined to believe, that the labours of
Peisistratus were wholly of an editorial character, although, I must
confess, that I can lay down nothing respecting the extent of his
labours. At the same time, so far from believing that the composition
or primary arrangement of these poems, in their present form, was the
work of Peisistratus, I am rather persuaded that the fine taste and
elegant mind of that Athenian<note place="foot"><p>"Who," says Cicero, de Orat.
iii. 34, "was more learned in that age, or whose eloquence is reported
to have been more perfected by literature than that of Peisistratus,
who is said first to have disposed the books of Homer in the order in
which we now have them?" Compare Wolf's Prolegomena, Section 33</p></note> would
lead him to preserve an ancient and traditional order of the poems,
rather than to patch and re-construct them according to a fanciful
hypothesis. I will not repeat the many discussions respecting whether
the poems were written or not, or whether the art of writing was known
in the time of their reputed author. Suffice it to say, that the more
we read, the less satisfied we are upon either subject.</p>

<pb n="xxiv" /><anchor id="Pgxxiv" />

<p>I cannot, however, help thinking, that the story which attributes the
preservation of these poems to Lycurgus, is little else than a version
of the same story as that of Peisistratus, while its historical
probability must be measured by that of many others relating to the
Spartan Confucius.</p>

<p>I will conclude this sketch of the Homeric theories, with an attempt,
made by an ingenious friend, to unite them into something like
consistency. It is as follows:—</p>

<quote rend="display">
<p>"No doubt the common soldiers of that age had, like the common sailors
of some fifty years ago, some one qualified to 'discourse in excellent
music' among them. Many of these, like those of the negroes in the
United States, were extemporaneous, and allusive to events passing
around them. But what was passing around them? The grand events of a
spirit-stirring war; occurrences likely to impress themselves, as the
mystical legends of former times had done, upon their memory; besides
which, a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water, and
was cultivated accordingly in those ancient times. Ballads at first,
and down to the beginning of the war with Troy, were merely
recitations, with an intonation. Then followed a species of recitative,
probably with an intoned burden. Tune next followed, as it aided the
memory considerably.</p>

<p>"It was at this period, about four hundred years after the war, that a
poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes, or Moeonides, but most
probably the former. He saw that these ballads might be made of great
utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of
Hellas, and, as a collection, he published these lays, connecting them
by a tale of his own. This poem now exists, under the title of the
'Odyssea.' The author, however, did not affix his own name to the poem,
which, in fact, was, great part of it, remodelled from the archaic
dialect of Crete, in which tongue the ballads were found by him. He
therefore called it the poem of Homeros, or the Collector; but this is
rather a proof of his modesty and talent, than of his mere drudging
arrangement of other people's ideas; for, as Grote has finely observed,
arguing for the unity of authorship, 'a great poet might have re-cast
pre-existing separate songs into one comprehensive whole; but no mere
arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so.'</p>

<p>"While employed on the wild legend of Odysseus, he met with a ballad,
recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon. His noble mind seized
the hint that there presented itself, and the Achilleis<note place="foot"><p>"The
first book, together with the eighth, and the books from the eleventh
to the twenty-second inclusive, seems to form the primary organization
of the poem, then properly an Achilleis."—Grote, vol. ii. p. 235</p></note> grew
under his hand. Unity of design, however, caused him to publish the
poem under the same pseudonyme as his former work: and the disjointed
lays of the ancient bards were joined together, like those relating to
the Cid, into a chronicle history, named the Iliad. Melesigenes knew
that the poem was destined to be a lasting one, and so it has proved;
but, first, the poems were destined to undergo many vicissitudes and
corruptions, by the people who took to singing them in the streets,
assemblies, and agoras. However, Solon first, and then<pb n="xxv" /><anchor id="Pgxxv" /> Peisistratus,
and afterwards Aristoteles and others, revised the poems, and restored
the works of Melesigenes Homeros to their original integrity in a great
measure."<note place="foot"><p>K. R. H. Mackenzie, Notes and Queries, p. 222
sqq.</p></note></p>
</quote>

<p>Having thus given some general notion of the strange theories which
have developed themselves respecting this most interesting subject, I
must still express my conviction as to the unity of the authorship of
the Homeric poems. To deny that many corruptions and interpolations
disfigure them, and that the intrusive hand of the poetasters may here
and there have inflicted a wound more serious than the negligence of
the copyist, would be an absurd and captious assumption, but it is to a
higher criticism that we must appeal, if we would either understand or
enjoy these poems. In maintaining the authenticity and personality of
their one author, be he Homer or Melesigenes, <hi rend="font-style: italic">quocunque nomine
vocari eum jus fasque sit,</hi> I feel conscious that, while the whole
weight of historical evidence is against the hypothesis which would
assign these great works to a plurality of authors, the most powerful
internal evidence, and that which springs from the deepest and most
immediate impulse of the soul, also speaks eloquently to the contrary.</p>

<p>The minutiae of verbal criticism I am far from seeking to despise.
Indeed, considering the character of some of my own books, such an
attempt would be gross inconsistency. But, while I appreciate its
importance in a philological view, I am inclined to set little store on
its aesthetic value, especially in poetry. Three parts of the
emendations made upon poets are mere alterations, some of which, had
they been suggested to the author by his Maecenas or Africanus, he
would probably have adopted. Moreover, those who are most exact in
laying down rules of verbal criticism and interpretation, are often
least competent to carry out their own precepts. Grammarians are not
poets by profession, but may be so <hi rend="font-style: italic">per accidens.</hi> I do not at
this moment remember two emendations on Homer, calculated to
substantially improve the poetry of a passage, although a mass of
remarks, from Herodotus down to Loewe, have given us the history of a
thousand minute points, without which our Greek knowledge would be
gloomy and jejune.</p>

<p>But it is not on words only that grammarians, mere grammarians, will
exercise their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity. Binding down an
heroic or dramatic poet to the block upon which they have previously
dissected his words and sentences, they proceed to use the axe and the
pruning knife by wholesale, and inconsistent in everything but their
wish to make out a case of unlawful affiliation, they cut out book
after book, passage after passage, till the author is reduced to a
collection of fragments, or till those, who fancied they possessed the
works of some great man, find that they have been put off with a vile
counterfeit got up at second hand. If we compare the theories of
Knight, Wolf, Lachmann, and others, we shall feel better satisfied of
the utter uncertainty of criticism than of the apocryphal position of
Homer. One rejects what another considers the turning-point of his<pb n="xxvi" /><anchor id="Pgxxvi" />
theory. One cuts a supposed knot by expunging what another would
explain by omitting something else.</p>

<p>Nor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon
as a literary novelty. Justus Lipsius, a scholar of no ordinary skill,
seems to revel in the imaginary discovery, that the tragedies
attributed to Seneca are by <hi rend="font-style: italic">four</hi> different authors.<note place="foot"><p>See his Epistle to Raphelingius, in Schroeder's edition, 4to., Delphis,
1728.</p></note> Now, I will venture to assert, that these tragedies are so
uniform, not only in their borrowed phraseology—a phraseology with
which writers like Boethius and Saxo Grammaticus were more charmed than
ourselves—in their freedom from real poetry, and last, but not least,
in an ultra-refined and consistent abandonment of good taste, that few
writers of the present day would question the capabilities of the same
gentleman, be he Seneca or not, to produce not only these, but a great
many more equally bad. With equal sagacity, Father Hardouin astonished
the world with the startling announcement that the Æneid of Virgil,
and the satires of Horace, were literary deceptions. Now, without
wishing to say one word of disrespect against the industry and
learning—nay, the refined acuteness—which scholars, like Wolf, have
bestowed upon this subject, I must express my fears, that many of our
modern Homeric theories will become matter for the surprise and
entertainment, rather than the instruction, of posterity. Nor can I
help thinking, that the literary history of more recent times will
account for many points of difficulty in the transmission of the Iliad
and Odyssey to a period so remote from that of their first creation.</p>

<p>I have already expressed my belief that the labours of Peisistratus
were of a purely editorial character; and there seems no more reason
why corrupt and imperfect editions of Homer may not have been abroad in
his day, than that the poems of Valerius Flaccus and Tibullus should
have given so much trouble to Poggio, Scaliger, and others. But, after
all, the main fault in all the Homeric theories is, that they demand
too great a sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry most powerfully
appeals, and which are its most fitting judges. The ingenuity which has
sought to rob us of the name and existence of Homer, does too much
violence to that inward emotion, which makes our whole soul yearn with
love and admiration for the blind bard of Chios. To believe the author
of the Iliad a mere compiler, is to degrade the powers of human
invention; to elevate analytical judgment at the expense of the most
ennobling impulses of the soul; and to forget the ocean in the
contemplation of a polypus. There is a catholicity, so to speak, in the
very name of Homer. Our faith in the author of the Iliad may be a
mistaken one, but as yet nobody has taught us a better.</p>

<p>While, however, I look upon the belief in Homer as one that has nature
herself for its mainspring; while I can join with old Ennius in
believing in Homer as the ghost, who, like some patron saint, hovers
round the bed of the poet, and even bestows rare gifts from that wealth
of imagination which a host of imitators could not exhaust,—still I am
far from wishing to deny that the author of these great poems found a
rich fund of tradition, a well-stocked mythical storehouse from whence<pb n="xxvii" /><anchor id="Pgxxvii" />
he might derive both subject and embellishment. But it is one thing to
<hi rend="font-style: italic">use</hi> existing romances in the embellishment of a poem, another to
patch up the poem itself from such materials. What consistency of style
and execution can be hoped for from such an attempt? or, rather, what
bad taste and tedium will not be the infallible result?</p>

<p>A blending of popular legends, and a free use of the songs of other
bards, are features perfectly consistent with poetical originality. In
fact, the most original writer is still drawing upon outward
impressions—nay, even his own thoughts are a kind of secondary agents
which support and feed the impulses of imagination. But unless there be
some grand pervading principle—some invisible, yet most distinctly
stamped archetypus of the great whole, a poem like the Iliad can never
come to the birth. Traditions the most picturesque, episodes the most
pathetic, local associations teeming with the thoughts of gods and
great men, may crowd in one mighty vision, or reveal themselves in more
substantial forms to the mind of the poet; but, except the power to
create a grand whole, to which these shall be but as details and
embellishments, be present, we shall have nought but a scrap-book, a
parterre filled with flowers and weeds strangling each other in their
wild redundancy: we shall have a cento of rags and tatters, which will
require little acuteness to detect.</p>

<p>Sensible as I am of the difficulty of disproving a negative, and aware
as I must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my belief,
it still seems to me that the Homeric question is one that is reserved
for a higher criticism than it has often obtained. We are not by nature
intended to know all things; still less, to compass the powers by which
the greatest blessings of life have been placed at our disposal. Were
faith no virtue, then we might indeed wonder why God willed our
ignorance on any matter. But we are too well taught the contrary
lesson; and it seems as though our faith should be especially tried
touching the men and the events which have wrought most influence upon
the condition of humanity. And there is a kind of sacredness attached
to the memory of the great and the good, which seems to bid us repulse
the scepticism which would allegorize their existence into a pleasing
apologue, and measure the giants of intellect by an homeopathic
dynameter.</p>

<p>Long and habitual reading of Homer appears to familiarize our thoughts
even to his incongruities; or rather, if we read in a right spirit and
with a heartfelt appreciation, we are too much dazzled, too deeply
wrapped in admiration of the whole, to dwell upon the minute spots
which mere analysis can discover. In reading an heroic poem we must
transform ourselves into heroes of the time being, we in imagination
must fight over the same battles, woo the same loves, burn with the
same sense of injury, as an Achilles or a Hector. And if we can but
attain this degree of enthusiasm (and less enthusiasm will scarcely
suffice for the reading of Homer), we shall feel that the poems of
Homer are not only the work of one writer, but of the greatest writer
that ever touched the hearts of men by the power of song.</p>

<p>And it was this supposed unity of authorship which gave these poems
their powerful influence over the minds of the men of old.<pb n="xxviii" /><anchor id="Pgxxviii" /> Heeren, who
is evidently little disposed in favour of modern theories, finely
observes:—</p>

<quote rend="display">
<p>"It was Homer who formed the character of the Greek nation. No poet has
ever, as a poet, exercised a similar influence over his countrymen.
Prophets, lawgivers, and sages have formed the character of other
nations; it was reserved to a poet to form that of the Greeks. This is
a feature in their character which was not wholly erased even in the
period of their degeneracy. When lawgivers and sages appeared in
Greece, the work of the poet had already been accomplished; and they
paid homage to his superior genius. He held up before his nation the
mirror, in which they were to behold the world of gods and heroes no
less than of feeble mortals, and to behold them reflected with purity
and truth. His poems are founded on the first feeling of human nature;
on the love of children, wife, and country; on that passion which
outweighs all others, the love of glory. His songs were poured forth
from a breast which sympathized with all the feelings of man; and
therefore they enter, and will continue to enter, every breast which
cherishes the same sympathies. If it is granted to his immortal spirit,
from another heaven than any of which he dreamed on earth, to look down
on his race, to see the nations from the fields of Asia to the forests
of Hercynia, performing pilgrimages to the fountain which his magic
wand caused to flow; if it is permitted to him to view the vast
assemblage of grand, of elevated, of glorious productions, which had
been called into being by means of his songs; wherever his immortal
spirit may reside, this alone would suffice to complete his happiness."<note place="foot"><p>Ancient Greece, p. 101.</p></note></p>

<p>Can we contemplate that ancient monument, on which the "Apotheosis of
Homer"<note place="foot"><p>The best description of this monument will be found
in Vaux's "Antiquities of the British Museum," p. 198 sq. The monument
itself (Towneley Sculptures, No. 123) is well known.</p></note> is depictured,
and not feel how much of pleasing association, how much that appeals
most forcibly and most distinctly to our minds, is lost by the
admittance of any theory but our old tradition? The more we read, and
the more we think—think as becomes the readers of Homer,—the more
rooted becomes the conviction that the Father of Poetry gave us this
rich inheritance, whole and entire. Whatever were the means of its
preservation, let us rather be thankful for the treasury of taste and
eloquence thus laid open to our use, than seek to make it a mere centre
around which to drive a series of theories, whose wildness is only
equalled by their inconsistency with each other.</p>

<p>As the hymns, and some other poems usually ascribed to Homer, are not
included in Pope's translation, I will content myself with a brief
account of the Battle of the Frogs and Mice, from the pen of a writer
who has done it full justice<note place="foot"><p>Coleridge, Classic Poets, p.
276.</p></note>:—</p>

<quote rend="display">
<p>"This poem," says Coleridge, "is a short mock-heroic of ancient date.
The text varies in different editions, and is obviously disturbed and
corrupt to a great degree; it is commonly said to have been a juvenile
essay of Homer's genius; others have attributed it to the same Pigrees,<pb n="xxix" /><anchor id="Pgxxix" />
mentioned above, and whose reputation for humour seems to have invited
the appropriation of any piece of ancient wit, the author of which was
uncertain; so little did the Greeks, before the age of the Ptolemies,
know or care about that department of criticism employed in determining
the genuineness of ancient writings. As to this little poem being a
youthful prolusion of Homer, it seems sufficient to say that from the
beginning to the end it is a plain and palpable parody, not only of the
general spirit, but of the numerous passages of the Iliad itself; and
even, if no such intention to parody were discernible in it, the
objection would still remain, that to suppose a work of mere burlesque
to be the primary effort of poetry in a simple age, seems to reverse
that order in the development of national taste, which the history of
every other people in Europe, and of many in Asia, has almost
ascertained to be a law of the human mind; it is in a state of society
much more refined and permanent than that described in the Iliad, that
any popularity would attend such a ridicule of war and the gods as is
contained in this poem; and the fact of there having existed three
other poems of the same kind attributed, for aught we can see, with as
much reason to Homer, is a strong inducement to believe that none of
them were of the Homeric age. Knight infers from the usage of the word
deltos, "writing tablet," instead of diphthera, "skin," which,
according to Herod. 5, 58, was the material employed by the Asiatic
Greeks for that purpose, that this poem was another offspring of Attic
ingenuity; and generally that the familiar mention of the cock (v. 191)
is a strong argument against so ancient a date for its composition."</p>
</quote>

<p>Having thus given a brief account of the poems comprised in Pope's
design, I will now proceed to make a few remarks on his translation,
and on my own purpose in the present edition.</p>

<p>Pope was not a Grecian. His whole education had been irregular, and his
earliest acquaintance with the poet was through the version of Ogilby.
It is not too much to say that his whole work bears the impress of a
disposition to be satisfied with the general sense, rather than to dive
deeply into the minute and delicate features of language. Hence his
whole work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a
translation. There are, to be sure, certain conventional anecdotes,
which prove that Pope consulted various friends, whose classical
attainments were sounder than his own, during the undertaking; but it
is probable that these examinations were the result rather of the
contradictory versions already existing, than of a desire to make a
perfect transcript of the original. And in those days, what is called
literal translation was less cultivated than at present. If something
like the general sense could be decorated with the easy gracefulness of
a practised poet; if the charms of metrical cadence and a pleasing
fluency could be made consistent with a fair interpretation of the
poet's meaning, his <hi rend="font-style: italic">words</hi> were less jealously sought for, and those
who could read so good a poem as Pope's Iliad had fair reason to be
satisfied.</p>

<p>It would be absurd, therefore, to test Pope's translation by our own
advancing knowledge of the original text. We must be content to<pb n="xxx" /><anchor id="Pgxxx" /> look at
it as a most delightful work in itself,—a work which is as much a part
of English literature as Homer himself is of Greek. We must not be torn
from our kindly associations with the old Iliad, that once was our most
cherished companion, or our most looked-for prize, merely because
Buttmann, Loewe, and Liddell have made us so much more accurate as to
amphikupellon being an adjective, and not a substantive. Far be it from
us to defend the faults of Pope, especially when we think of Chapman's
fine, bold, rough old English;—far be it from, us to hold up his
translation as what a translation of Homer <hi rend="font-style: italic">might</hi> be. But we can
still dismiss Pope's Iliad to the hands of our readers, with the
consciousness that they must have read a very great number of books
before they have read its fellow.</p>

<p>As to the Notes accompanying the present volume, they are drawn up
without pretension, and mainly with the view of helping the general
reader. Having some little time since translated all the works of Homer
for another publisher, I might have brought a large amount of
accumulated matter, sometimes of a critical character, to bear upon the
text. But Pope's version was no field for such a display; and my
purpose was to touch briefly on antiquarian or mythological allusions,
to notice occasionally <hi rend="font-style: italic">some</hi> departures from the original, and to
give a few parallel passages from our English Homer, Milton. In the
latter task I cannot pretend to novelty, but I trust that my other
annotations, while utterly disclaiming high scholastic views, will be
found to convey as much as is wanted; at least, as far as the necessary
limits of these volumes could be expected to admit. To write a
commentary on Homer is not my present aim; but if I have made Pope's
translation a little more entertaining and instructive to a mass of
miscellaneous readers, I shall consider my wishes satisfactorily
accomplished.</p>

<head>POPE'S PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMER</head>

<p>Homer is universally allowed to have had the greatest invention of any
writer whatever. The praise of judgment Virgil has justly contested
with him, and others may have their pretensions as to particular
excellences; but his invention remains yet unrivalled. Nor is it a
wonder if he has ever been acknowledged the greatest of poets, who most
excelled in that which is the very foundation of poetry. It is the
invention that, in different degrees, distinguishes all great geniuses:
the utmost stretch of human study, learning, and industry, which
masters everything besides, can never attain to this. It furnishes art
with all her materials, and without it judgment itself can at best but
"steal wisely:" for art is only like a prudent steward that lives on
managing the riches of nature. Whatever praises may be given to works
of judgment, there is not even a single beauty in them to which the
invention must not contribute: as in the most regular gardens, art can
only reduce beauties of nature to more regularity, and such a figure,
which the common eye may better take in, and is, therefore, more
entertained with. And, perhaps, the reason why common critics are
inclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to a great and
fruitful one, is, because they find it easier for themselves to pursue
their observations through a uniform and bounded walk of art, than to
comprehend the vast and various extent of nature.</p>

<p>Our author's work is a wild paradise, where, if we cannot see all the
beauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden, it is only because the
number of them is infinitely greater. It is like a copious nursery,
which contains the seeds and first productions of every kind, out of
which those who followed him have but selected some particular plants,
each according to his fancy, to cultivate and beautify. If some things
are too luxuriant it is owing to the richness of the soil; and if
others are not arrived to perfection or maturity, it is only because
they are overrun and oppressed by those of a stronger nature.</p>

<p>It is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attribute
that unequalled fire and rapture which is so forcible in Homer, that no
man of a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads him.
What he writes is of the most animated nature imaginable; every thing
moves, every thing lives, and is put in action. If a council be called,
or a battle fought, you are not coldly informed of what was said<pb n="xxxii" /><anchor id="Pgxxxii" /> or
done as from a third person; the reader is hurried out of himself by
the force of the poet's imagination, and turns in one place to a
hearer, in another to a spectator. The course of his verses resembles
that of the army he describes,</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hoid' ar' isan hosei te puri chthon pasa nemoito.</l>
</lg>

<p>"They pour along like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it." It
is, however, remarkable, that his fancy, which is everywhere vigorous,
is not discovered immediately at the beginning of his poem in its
fullest splendour: it grows in the progress both upon himself and
others, and becomes on fire, like a chariot-wheel, by its own rapidity.
Exact disposition, just thought, correct elocution, polished numbers,
may have been found in a thousand; but this poetic fire, this "vivida
vis animi," in a very few. Even in works where all those are imperfect
or neglected, this can overpower criticism, and make us admire even
while we disapprove. Nay, where this appears, though attended with
absurdities, it brightens all the rubbish about it, till we see nothing
but its own splendour. This fire is discerned in Virgil, but discerned
as through a glass, reflected from Homer, more shining than fierce, but
everywhere equal and constant: in Lucan and Statius it bursts out in
sudden, short, and interrupted flashes: In Milton it glows like a
furnace kept up to an uncommon ardour by the force of art: in
Shakspeare it strikes before we are aware, like an accidental fire from
heaven: but in Homer, and in him only, it burns everywhere clearly and
everywhere irresistibly.</p>

<p>I shall here endeavour to show how this vast invention exerts itself in
a manner superior to that of any poet through all the main constituent
parts of his work: as it is the great and peculiar characteristic which
distinguishes him from all other authors.</p>

<p>This strong and ruling faculty was like a powerful star, which, in the
violence of its course, drew all things within its vortex. It seemed
not enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts, and the whole
compass of nature, to supply his maxims and reflections; all the inward
passions and affections of mankind, to furnish his characters: and all
the outward forms and images of things for his descriptions: but
wanting yet an ampler sphere to expatiate in, he opened a new and
boundless walk for his imagination, and created a world for himself in
the invention of fable. That which Aristotle calls "the soul of
poetry," was first breathed into it by Homer, I shall begin with
considering him in his part, as it is naturally the first; and I speak
of it both as it means the design of a poem, and as it is taken for
fiction.</p>

<p>Fable may be divided into the probable, the allegorical, and the
marvellous. The probable fable is the recital of such actions as,
though they did not happen, yet might, in the common course of nature;
or of such as, though they did, became fables by the additional
episodes and manner of telling them. Of this sort is the main story of
an epic poem, "The return of Ulysses, the settlement of the Trojans in
Italy," or the like. That of the Iliad is the "anger of Achilles," the
most short and single subject that ever was chosen by any poet. Yet
this he has supplied with a vaster variety of incidents<pb n="xxxiii" /><anchor id="Pgxxxiii" /> and events, and
crowded with a greater number of councils, speeches, battles, and
episodes of all kinds, than are to be found even in those poems whose
schemes are of the utmost latitude and irregularity. The action is
hurried on with the most vehement spirit, and its whole duration
employs not so much as fifty days. Virgil, for want of so warm a
genius, aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject, as well as
a greater length of time, and contracting the design of both Homer's
poems into one, which is yet but a fourth part as large as his. The
other epic poets have used the same practice, but generally carried it
so far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables, destroy the unity of
action, and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time. Nor
is it only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his
invention, but they have followed him in every episode and part of
story. If he has given a regular catalogue of an army, they all draw up
their forces in the same order. If he has funeral games for Patroclus,
Virgil has the same for Anchises, and Statius (rather than omit them)
destroys the unity of his actions for those of Archemorus. If Ulysses
visit the shades, the Æneas of Virgil and Scipio of Silius are sent
after him. If he be detained from his return by the allurements of
Calypso, so is Æneas by Dido, and Rinaldo by Armida. If Achilles be
absent from the army on the score of a quarrel through half the poem,
Rinaldo must absent himself just as long on the like account. If he
gives his hero a suit of celestial armour, Virgil and Tasso make the
same present to theirs. Virgil has not only observed this close
imitation of Homer, but, where he had not led the way, supplied the
want from other Greek authors. Thus the story of Sinon, and the taking
of Troy, was copied (says Macrobius) almost word for word from
Pisander, as the loves of Dido and Æneas are taken from those of Medea
and Jason in Apollonius, and several others in the same manner.</p>

<p>To proceed to the allegorical fable—If we reflect upon those
innumerable knowledges, those secrets of nature and physical philosophy
which Homer is generally supposed to have wrapped up in his allegories,
what a new and ample scene of wonder may this consideration afford us!
How fertile will that imagination appear, which as able to clothe all
the properties of elements, the qualifications of the mind, the virtues
and vices, in forms and persons, and to introduce them into actions
agreeable to the nature of the things they shadowed! This is a field in
which no succeeding poets could dispute with Homer, and whatever
commendations have been allowed them on this head, are by no means for
their invention in having enlarged his circle, but for their judgment
in having contracted it. For when the mode of learning changed in the
following ages, and science was delivered in a plainer manner, it then
became as reasonable in the more modern poets to lay it aside, as it
was in Homer to make use of it. And perhaps it was no unhappy
circumstance for Virgil, that there was not in his time that demand
upon him of so great an invention as might be capable of furnishing all
those allegorical parts of a poem.</p>

<p>The marvellous fable includes whatever is supernatural, and especially
the machines of the gods. If Homer was not the first who introduced the
deities (as Herodotus imagines) into the religion of<pb n="xxxiv" /><anchor id="Pgxxxiv" /> Greece, he seems
the first who brought them into a system of machinery for poetry, and
such a one as makes its greatest importance and dignity: for we find
those authors who have been offended at the literal notion of the gods,
constantly laying their accusation against Homer as the chief support
of it. But whatever cause there might be to blame his machines in a
philosophical or religious view, they are so perfect in the poetic,
that mankind have been ever since contented to follow them: none have
been able to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond the limits he has set:
every attempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful; and after all the
various changes of times and religions, his gods continue to this day
the gods of poetry.</p>

<p>We come now to the characters of his persons; and here we shall find no
author has ever drawn so many, with so visible and surprising a
variety, or given us such lively and affecting impressions of them.
Every one has something so singularly his own, that no painter could
have distinguished them more by their features, than the poet has by
their manners. Nothing can be more exact than the distinctions he has
observed in the different degrees of virtues and vices. The single
quality of courage is wonderfully diversified in the several characters
of the Iliad. That of Achilles is furious and intractable; that of
Diomede forward, yet listening to advice, and subject to command; that
of Ajax is heavy and self-confiding; of Hector, active and vigilant:
the courage of Agamemnon is inspirited by love of empire and ambition;
that of Menelaus mixed with softness and tenderness for his people: we
find in Idomeneus a plain direct soldier; in Sarpedon a gallant and
generous one. Nor is this judicious and astonishing diversity to be
found only in the principal quality which constitutes the main of each
character, but even in the under parts of it, to which he takes care to
give a tincture of that principal one. For example: the main characters
of Ulysses and Nestor consist in wisdom; and they are distinct in this,
that the wisdom of one is artificial and various, of the other natural,
open, and regular. But they have, besides, characters of courage; and
this quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference of
his prudence; for one in the war depends still upon caution, the other
upon experience. It would be endless to produce instances of these
kinds. The characters of Virgil are far from striking us in this open
manner; they lie, in a great degree, hidden and undistinguished; and,
where they are marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to
those of Homer. His characters of valour are much alike; even that of
Turnus seems no way peculiar, but, as it is, in a superior degree; and
we see nothing that differences the courage of Mnestheus from that of
Sergestus, Cloanthus, or the rest, In like manner it may be remarked of
Statius's heroes, that an air of impetuosity runs through them all; the
same horrid and savage courage appears in his Capaneus, Tydeus,
Hippomedon, &amp;c. They have a parity of character, which makes them seem
brothers of one family. I believe when the reader is led into this
tract of reflection, if he will pursue it through the epic and tragic
writers, he will be convinced how infinitely superior, in this point,
the invention of Homer was to that of all others.</p>

<pb n="xxxv" /><anchor id="xxxv" />

<p>The speeches are to be considered as they flow from the characters;
being perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manners,
of those who utter them. As there is more variety of characters in the
Iliad, so there is of speeches, than in any other poem. "Everything in
it has manner" (as Aristotle expresses it), that is, everything is
acted or spoken. It is hardly credible, in a work of such length, how
small a number of lines are employed in narration. In Virgil the
dramatic part is less in proportion to the narrative, and the speeches
often consist of general reflections or thoughts, which might be
equally just in any person's mouth upon the same occasion. As many of
his persons have no apparent characters, so many of his speeches escape
being applied and judged by the rule of propriety. We oftener think of
the author himself when we read Virgil, than when we are engaged in
Homer, all which are the effects of a colder invention, that interests
us less in the action described. Homer makes us hearers, and Virgil
leaves us readers.</p>

<p>If, in the next place, we take a view of the sentiments, the same
presiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his
thoughts. Longinus has given his opinion, that it was in this part
Homer principally excelled. What were alone sufficient to prove the
grandeur and excellence of his sentiments in general, is, that they
have so remarkable a parity with those of the Scripture. Duport, in his
Gnomologia Homerica, has collected innumerable instances of this sort.
And it is with justice an excellent modern writer allows, that if
Virgil has not so many thoughts that are low and vulgar, he has not so
many that are sublime and noble; and that the Roman author seldom rises
into very astonishing sentiments where he is not fired by the Iliad.</p>

<p>If we observe his descriptions, images, and similes, we shall find the
invention still predominant. To what else can we ascribe that vast
comprehension of images of every sort, where we see each circumstance
of art, and individual of nature, summoned together by the extent and
fecundity of his imagination to which all things, in their various
views presented themselves in an instant, and had their impressions
taken off to perfection at a heat? Nay, he not only gives us the full
prospects of things, but several unexpected peculiarities and side
views, unobserved by any painter but Homer. Nothing is so surprising as
the descriptions of his battles, which take up no less than half the
Iliad, and are supplied with so vast a variety of incidents, that no
one bears a likeness to another; such different kinds of deaths, that
no two heroes are wounded in the same manner, and such a profusion of
noble ideas, that every battle rises above the last in greatness,
horror, and confusion. It is certain there is not near that number of
images and descriptions in any epic poet, though every one has assisted
himself with a great quantity out of him; and it is evident of Virgil
especially, that he has scarce any comparisons which are not drawn from
his master.</p>

<p>If we descend from hence to the expression, we see the bright
imagination of Homer shining out in the most enlivened forms of it. We
acknowledge him the father of poetical diction; the first who taught
that "language of the gods" to men. His expression is like<pb n="xxxvi" /><anchor id="Pgxxxvi" /> the
colouring of some great masters, which discovers itself to be laid on
boldly, and executed with rapidity. It is, indeed, the strongest and
most glowing imaginable, and touched with the greatest spirit.
Aristotle had reason to say, he was the only poet who had found out
"living words;" there are in him more daring figures and metaphors than
in any good author whatever. An arrow is "impatient" to be on the wing,
a weapon "thirsts" to drink the blood of an enemy, and the like, yet
his expression is never too big for the sense, but justly great in
proportion to it. It is the sentiment that swells and fills out the
diction, which rises with it, and forms itself about it, for in the
same degree that a thought is warmer, an expression will be brighter,
as that is more strong, this will become more perspicuous; like glass
in the furnace, which grows to a greater magnitude, and refines to a
greater clearness, only as the breath within is more powerful, and the
heat more intense.</p>

<p>To throw his language more out of prose, Homer seems to have affected
the compound epithets. This was a sort of composition peculiarly proper
to poetry, not only as it heightened the diction, but as it assisted
and filled the numbers with greater sound and pomp, and likewise
conduced in some measure to thicken the images. On this last
consideration I cannot but attribute these also to the fruitfulness of
his invention, since (as he has managed them) they are a sort of
supernumerary pictures of the persons or things to which they were
joined. We see the motion of Hector's plumes in the epithet
Korythaiolos, the landscape of Mount Neritus in that of Einosiphyllos,
and so of others, which particular images could not have been insisted
upon so long as to express them in a description (though but of a
single line) without diverting the reader too much from the principal
action or figure. As a metaphor is a short simile, one of these
epithets is a short description.</p>

<p>Lastly, if we consider his versification, we shall be sensible what a
share of praise is due to his invention in that also. He was not
satisfied with his language as he found it settled in any one part of
Greece, but searched through its different dialects with this
particular view, to beautify and perfect his numbers he considered
these as they had a greater mixture of vowels or consonants, and
accordingly employed them as the verse required either a greater
smoothness or strength. What he most affected was the Ionic, which has
a peculiar sweetness, from its never using contractions, and from its
custom of resolving the diphthongs into two syllables, so as to make
the words open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous fluency.
With this he mingled the Attic contractions, the broader Doric, and the
feebler Æolic, which often rejects its aspirate, or takes off its
accent, and completed this variety by altering some letters with the
licence of poetry. Thus his measures, instead of being fetters to his
sense, were always in readiness to run along with the warmth of his
rapture, and even to give a further representation of his notions, in
the correspondence of their sounds to what they signified. Out of all
these he has derived that harmony which makes us confess he had not
only the richest head, but the finest ear in the world. This is so
great a truth, that whoever will but<pb n="xxxvii" /><anchor id="Pgxxxvii" /> consult the tune of his verses,
even without understanding them (with the same sort of diligence as we
daily see practised in the case of Italian operas), will find more
sweetness, variety, and majesty of sound, than in any other language of
poetry. The beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics to be
copied but faintly by Virgil himself, though they are so just as to
ascribe it to the nature of the Latin tongue: indeed the Greek has some
advantages both from the natural sound of its words, and the turn and
cadence of its verse, which agree with the genius of no other language.
Virgil was very sensible of this, and used the utmost diligence in
working up a more intractable language to whatsoever graces it was
capable of, and, in particular, never failed to bring the sound of his
line to a beautiful agreement with its sense. If the Grecian poet has
not been so frequently celebrated on this account as the Roman, the
only reason is, that fewer critics have understood one language than
the other. Dionysius of Halicarnassus has pointed out many of our
author's beauties in this kind, in his treatise of the Composition of
Words. It suffices at present to observe of his numbers, that they flow
with so much ease, as to make one imagine Homer had no other care than
to transcribe as fast as the Muses dictated, and, at the same time,
with so much force and inspiriting vigour, that they awaken and raise
us like the sound of a trumpet. They roll along as a plentiful river,
always in motion, and always full; while we are borne away by a tide of
verse, the most rapid, and yet the most smooth imaginable.</p>

<p>Thus on whatever side we contemplate Homer, what principally strikes us
is his invention. It is that which forms the character of each part of
his work; and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more
extensive and copious than any other, his manners more lively and
strongly marked, his speeches more affecting and transported, his
sentiments more warm and sublime, his images and descriptions more full
and animated, his expression more raised and daring, and his numbers
more rapid and various. I hope, in what has been said of Virgil, with
regard to any of these heads, I have no way derogated from his
character. Nothing is more absurd or endless, than the common method of
comparing eminent writers by an opposition of particular passages in
them, and forming a judgment from thence of their merit upon the whole.
We ought to have a certain knowledge of the principal character and
distinguishing excellence of each: it is in that we are to consider
him, and in proportion to his degree in that we are to admire him. No
author or man ever excelled all the world in more than one faculty; and
as Homer has done this in invention, Virgil has in judgment. Not that
we are to think that Homer wanted judgment, because Virgil had it in a
more eminent degree; or that Virgil wanted invention, because Homer
possessed a larger share of it; each of these great authors had more of
both than perhaps any man besides, and are only said to have less in
comparison with one another. Homer was the greater genius, Virgil the
better artist. In one we most admire the man, in the other the work.
Homer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity; Virgil
leads us with an attractive majesty; Homer scatters with a generous
profusion;<pb n="xxxviii" /><anchor id="Pgxxxviii" /> Virgil bestows with a careful magnificence; Homer, like the
Nile, pours out his riches with a boundless overflow; Virgil, like a
river in its banks, with a gentle and constant stream. When we behold
their battles, methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they
celebrate. Homer, boundless and resistless as Achilles, bears all
before him, and shines more and more as the tumult increases; Virgil,
calmly daring, like Æneas, appears undisturbed in the midst of the
action; disposes all about him, and conquers with tranquillity. And
when we look upon their machines, Homer seems like his own Jupiter in
his terrors, shaking Olympus, scattering the lightnings, and firing the
heavens: Virgil, like the same power in his benevolence, counselling
with the gods, laying plans for empires, and regularly ordering his
whole creation.</p>

<p>But after all, it is with great parts, as with great virtues, they
naturally border on some imperfection; and it is often hard to
distinguish exactly where the virtue ends, or the fault begins. As
prudence may sometimes sink to suspicion, so may a great judgment
decline to coldness; and as magnanimity may run up to profusion or
extravagance, so may a great invention to redundancy or wildness. If we
look upon Homer in this view, we shall perceive the chief objections
against him to proceed from so noble a cause as the excess of this
faculty.</p>

<p>Among these we may reckon some of his marvellous fictions, upon which
so much criticism has been spent, as surpassing all the bounds of
probability. Perhaps it may be with great and superior souls, as with
gigantic bodies, which, exerting themselves with unusual strength,
exceed what is commonly thought the due proportion of parts, to become
miracles in the whole; and, like the old heroes of that make, commit
something near extravagance, amidst a series of glorious and inimitable
performances. Thus Homer has his "speaking horses;" and Virgil his
"myrtles distilling blood;" where the latter has not so much as
contrived the easy intervention of a deity to save the probability.</p>

<p>It is owing to the same vast invention, that his similes have been
thought too exuberant and full of circumstances. The force of this
faculty is seen in nothing more, than in its inability to confine
itself to that single circumstance upon which the comparison is
grounded: it runs out into embellishments of additional images, which,
however, are so managed as not to overpower the main one. His similes
are like pictures, where the principal figure has not only its
proportion given agreeable to the original, but is also set off with
occasional ornaments and prospects. The same will account for his
manner of heaping a number of comparisons together in one breath, when
his fancy suggested to him at once so many various and correspondent
images. The reader will easily extend this observation to more
objections of the same kind.</p>

<p>If there are others which seem rather to charge him with a defect or
narrowness of genius, than an excess of it, those seeming defects will
be found upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the
times he lived in. Such are his grosser representations of the gods;
and the vicious and imperfect manners of his heroes; but I must here<pb n="xxxix" /><anchor id="xxxix" />
speak a word of the latter, as it is a point generally carried into
extremes, both by the censurers and defenders of Homer. It must be a
strange partiality to antiquity, to think with Madame Dacier,<note place="foot"><p>Preface to her Homer.</p></note>
"that those times and manners are so
much the more excellent, as they are more contrary to ours." Who can be
so prejudiced in their favour as to magnify the felicity of those ages,
when a spirit of revenge and cruelty, joined with the practice of
rapine and robbery, reigned through the world: when no mercy was shown
but for the sake of lucre; when the greatest princes were put to the
sword, and their wives and daughters made slaves and concubines? On the
other side, I would not be so delicate as those modern critics, who are
shocked at the servile offices and mean employments in which we
sometimes see the heroes of Homer engaged. There is a pleasure in
taking a view of that simplicity, in opposition to the luxury of
succeeding ages: in beholding monarchs without their guards; princes
tending their flocks, and princesses drawing water from the springs.
When we read Homer, we ought to reflect that we are reading the most
ancient author in the heathen world; and those who consider him in this
light, will double their pleasure in the perusal of him. Let them think
they are growing acquainted with nations and people that are now no
more; that they are stepping almost three thousand years back into the
remotest antiquity, and entertaining themselves with a clear and
surprising vision of things nowhere else to be found, the only true
mirror of that ancient world. By this means alone their greatest
obstacles will vanish; and what usually creates their dislike, will
become a satisfaction.</p>

<p>This consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of
the same epithets to his gods and heroes; such as the "far-darting
Phoebus," the "blue-eyed Pallas," the "swift-footed Achilles," &amp;c.,
which some have censured as impertinent, and tediously repeated. Those
of the gods depended upon the powers and offices then believed to
belong to them; and had contracted a weight and veneration from the
rites and solemn devotions in which they were used: they were a sort of
attributes with which it was a matter of religion to salute them on all
occasions, and which it was an irreverence to omit. As for the epithets
of great men, Mons. Boileau is of opinion, that they were in the nature
of surnames, and repeated as such; for the Greeks having no names
derived from their fathers, were obliged to add some other distinction
of each person; either naming his parents expressly, or his place of
birth, profession, or the like: as Alexander the son of Philip,
Herodotus of Halicarnassus, Diogenes the Cynic, &amp;c. Homer, therefore,
complying with the custom of his country, used such distinctive
additions as better agreed with poetry. And, indeed, we have something
parallel to these in modern times, such as the names of Harold
Harefoot, Edmund Ironside, Edward Longshanks, Edward the Black Prince,
&amp;c. If yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for
the repetition, I shall add a further conjecture. Hesiod, dividing the
world into its different ages, has placed a fourth age, between the
brazen and the iron one, of "heroes distinct from other<pb n="xl" /><anchor id="Pgxl" /> men; a divine
race who fought at Thebes and Troy, are called demi-gods, and live by
the care of Jupiter in the islands of the blessed." Now among the
divine honours which were paid them, they might have this also in
common with the gods, not to be mentioned without the solemnity of an
epithet, and such as might be acceptable to them by celebrating their
families, actions or qualities.</p>

<p>What other cavils have been raised against Homer, are such as hardly
deserve a reply, but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the
course of the work. Many have been occasioned by an injudicious
endeavour to exalt Virgil; which is much the same, as if one should
think to raise the superstructure by undermining the foundation: one
would imagine, by the whole course of their parallels, that these
critics never so much as heard of Homer's having written first; a
consideration which whoever compares these two poets ought to have
always in his eye. Some accuse him for the same things which they
overlook or praise in the other; as when they prefer the fable and
moral of the Æneis to those of the Iliad, for the same reasons which
might set the Odyssey above the Æneis; as that the hero is a wiser
man, and the action of the one more beneficial to his country than that
of the other; or else they blame him for not doing what he never
designed; as because Achilles is not as good and perfect a prince as
Æneas, when the very moral of his poem required a contrary character:
it is thus that Rapin judges in his comparison of Homer and Virgil.
Others select those particular passages of Homer which are not so
laboured as some that Virgil drew out of them: this is the whole
management of Scaliger in his Poetics. Others quarrel with what they
take for low and mean expressions, sometimes through a false delicacy
and refinement, oftener from an ignorance of the graces of the
original, and then triumph in the awkwardness of their own
translations: this is the conduct of Perrault in his Parallels. Lastly,
there are others, who, pretending to a fairer proceeding, distinguish
between the personal merit of Homer, and that of his work; but when
they come to assign the causes of the great reputation of the Iliad,
they found it upon the ignorance of his times, and the prejudice of
those that followed: and in pursuance of this principle, they make
those accidents (such as the contention of the cities, &amp;c.) to be the
causes of his fame, which were in reality the consequences of his
merit. The same might as well be said of Virgil, or any great author
whose general character will infallibly raise many casual additions to
their reputation. This is the method of Mons. de la Mott; who yet
confesses upon the whole that in whatever age Homer had lived, he must
have been the greatest poet of his nation, and that he may be said in
his sense to be the master even of those who surpassed him.<note place="foot"><p>Hesiod. Opp. et Dier. Lib. I. vers. 155, &amp;c.</p></note></p>

<p>In all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his title to
the honour of the chief invention: and as long as this (which is indeed
the characteristic of poetry itself) remains unequalled by his
followers, he still continues superior to them. A cooler judgment may
commit fewer faults, and be more approved in the eyes of one sort of
critics: but that warmth of fancy will carry the loudest and most<pb n="xli" /><anchor id="Pgxli" />
universal applauses which holds the heart of a reader under the
strongest enchantment. Homer not only appears the inventor of poetry,
but excels all the inventors of other arts, in this, that he has
swallowed up the honour of those who succeeded him. What he has done
admitted no increase, it only left room for contraction or regulation.
He showed all the stretch of fancy at once; and if he has failed in
some of his flights, it was but because he attempted everything. A work
of this kind seems like a mighty tree, which rises from the most
vigorous seed, is improved with industry, flourishes, and produces the
finest fruit: nature and art conspire to raise it; pleasure and profit
join to make it valuable: and they who find the justest faults, have
only said that a few branches which run luxuriant through a richness of
nature, might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance.</p>

<p>Having now spoken of the beauties and defects of the original, it
remains to treat of the translation, with the same view to the chief
characteristic. As far as that is seen in the main parts of the poem,
such as the fable, manners, and sentiments, no translator can prejudice
it but by wilful omissions or contractions. As it also breaks out in
every particular image, description, and simile, whoever lessens or too
much softens those, takes off from this chief character. It is the
first grand duty of an interpreter to give his author entire and
unmaimed; and for the rest, the diction and versification only are his
proper province, since these must be his own, but the others he is to
take as he finds them.</p>

<p>It should then be considered what methods may afford some equivalent in
our language for the graces of these in the Greek. It is certain no
literal translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior
language: but it is a great mistake to imagine (as many have done) that
a rash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect; which is no
less in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient, by deviating into the
modern manners of expression. If there be sometimes a darkness, there
is often a light in antiquity, which nothing better preserves than a
version almost literal. I know no liberties one ought to take, but
those which are necessary to transfusing the spirit of the original,
and supporting the poetical style of the translation: and I will
venture to say, there have not been more men misled in former times by
a servile, dull adherence to the letter, than have been deluded in ours
by a chimerical, insolent hope of raising and improving their author.
It is not to be doubted, that the fire of the poem is what a translator
should principally regard, as it is most likely to expire in his
managing: however, it is his safest way to be content with preserving
this to his utmost in the whole, without endeavouring to be more than
he finds his author is, in any particular place. It is a great secret
in writing, to know when to be plain, and when poetical and figurative;
and it is what Homer will teach us, if we will but follow modestly in
his footsteps. Where his diction is bold and lofty, let us raise ours
as high as we can; but where his is plain and humble, we ought not to
be deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the censure of
a mere English critic. Nothing that belongs to Homer<pb n="xlii" /><anchor id="Pgxlii" /> seems to have been
more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style: some of his
translators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of the
sublime; others sunk into flatness, in a cold and timorous notion of
simplicity. Methinks I see these different followers of Homer, some
sweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds (the
certain signs of false mettle), others slowly and servilely creeping in
his train, while the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an
unaffected and equal majesty before them. However, of the two extremes
one could sooner pardon frenzy than frigidity; no author is to be
envied for such commendations, as he may gain by that character of
style, which his friends must agree together to call simplicity, and
the rest of the world will call dulness. There is a graceful and
dignified simplicity, as well as a bold and sordid one; which differ as
much from each other as the air of a plain man from that of a sloven:
it is one thing to be tricked up, and another not to be dressed at all.
Simplicity is the mean between ostentation and rusticity.</p>

<p>This pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in the
Scripture and our author. One may affirm, with all respect to the
inspired writings, that the Divine Spirit made use of no other words
but what were intelligible and common to men at that time, and in that
part of the world; and, as Homer is the author nearest to those, his
style must of course bear a greater resemblance to the sacred books
than that of any other writer. This consideration (together with what
has been observed of the parity of some of his thoughts) may, methinks,
induce a translator, on the one hand, to give in to several of those
general phrases and manners of expression, which have attained a
veneration even in our language from being used in the Old Testament;
as, on the other, to avoid those which have been appropriated to the
Divinity, and in a manner consigned to mystery and religion.</p>

<p>For a further preservation of this air of simplicity, a particular care
should be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and
proverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet. They have
something venerable, and as I may say, oracular, in that unadorned
gravity and shortness with which they are delivered: a grace which
would be utterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a more
ingenious (that is, a more modern) turn in the paraphrase.</p>

<p>Perhaps the mixture of some Graecisms and old words after the manner of
Milton, if done without too much affectation, might not have an ill
effect in a version of this particular work, which most of any other
seems to require a venerable, antique cast. But certainly the use of
modern terms of war and government, such as "platoon, campaign, junto,"
or the like, (into which some of his translators have fallen) cannot be
allowable; those only excepted without which it is impossible to treat
the subjects in any living language.</p>

<p>There are two peculiarities in Homer's diction, which are a sort of
marks or moles by which every common eye distinguishes him at first
sight; those who are not his greatest admirers look upon them as
defects, and those who are, seemed pleased with them as beauties. I
speak of his compound epithets, and of his repetitions. Many of the<pb n="xliii" /><anchor id="Pgxliii" />
former cannot be done literally into English without destroying the
purity of our language. I believe such should be retained as slide
easily of themselves into an English compound, without violence to the
ear or to the received rules of composition, as well as those which
have received a sanction from the authority of our best poets, and are
become familiar through their use of them; such as "the cloud-compelling
Jove," &amp;c. As for the rest, whenever any can be as fully and
significantly expressed in a single word as in a compounded one, the
course to be taken is obvious.</p>

<p>Some that cannot be so turned, as to preserve their full image by one
or two words, may have justice done them by circumlocution; as the
epithet einosiphyllos to a mountain, would appear little or ridiculous
translated literally "leaf-shaking," but affords a majestic idea in the
periphrasis: "the lofty mountain shakes his waving woods." Others that
admit of different significations, may receive an advantage from a
judicious variation, according to the occasions on which they are
introduced. For example, the epithet of Apollo, hekaebolos or "far-shooting,"
is capable of two explications; one literal, in respect of
the darts and bow, the ensigns of that god; the other allegorical, with
regard to the rays of the sun; therefore, in such places where Apollo
is represented as a god in person, I would use the former
interpretation; and where the effects of the sun are described, I would
make choice of the latter. Upon the whole, it will be necessary to
avoid that perpetual repetition of the same epithets which we find in
Homer, and which, though it might be accommodated (as has been already
shown) to the ear of those times, is by no means so to ours: but one
may wait for opportunities of placing them, where they derive an
additional beauty from the occasions on which they are employed; and in
doing this properly, a translator may at once show his fancy and his
judgment.</p>

<p>As for Homer's repetitions, we may divide them into three sorts: of
whole narrations and speeches, of single sentences, and of one verse or
hemistitch. I hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these,
as neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand, nor
to offend the reader too much on the other. The repetition is not
ungraceful in those speeches, where the dignity of the speaker renders
it a sort of insolence to alter his words; as in the messages from gods
to men, or from higher powers to inferiors in concerns of state, or
where the ceremonial of religion seems to require it, in the solemn
forms of prayers, oaths, or the like. In other cases, I believe the
best rule is, to be guided by the nearness, or distance, at which the
repetitions are placed in the original: when they follow too close, one
may vary the expression; but it is a question, whether a professed
translator be authorized to omit any: if they be tedious, the author is
to answer for it.</p>

<p>It only remains to speak of the versification. Homer (as has been said)
is perpetually applying the sound to the sense, and varying it on every
new subject. This is indeed one of the most exquisite beauties of
poetry, and attainable by very few: I only know of Homer eminent for it
in the Greek, and Virgil in the Latin. I am sensible it is what may
sometimes happen by chance, when a writer is warm, and fully<pb n="xliv" /><anchor id="Pgxliv" /> possessed
of his image: however, it may reasonably be believed they designed
this, in whose verse it so manifestly appears in a superior degree to
all others. Few readers have the ear to be judges of it: but those who
have, will see I have endeavoured at this beauty.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, I must confess myself utterly incapable of doing
justice to Homer. I attempt him in no other hope but that which one may
entertain without much vanity, of giving a more tolerable copy of him
than any entire translation in verse has yet done. We have only those
of Chapman, Hobbes, and Ogilby. Chapman has taken the advantage of an
immeasurable length of verse, notwithstanding which, there is scarce
any paraphrase more loose and rambling than his. He has frequent
interpolations of four or six lines; and I remember one in the
thirteenth book of the Odyssey, ver. 312, where he has spun twenty
verses out of two. He is often mistaken in so bold a manner, that one
might think he deviated on purpose, if he did not in other places of
his notes insist so much upon verbal trifles. He appears to have had a
strong affectation of extracting new meanings out of his author;
insomuch as to promise, in his rhyming preface, a poem of the mysteries
he had revealed in Homer; and perhaps he endeavoured to strain the
obvious sense to this end. His expression is involved in fustian; a
fault for which he was remarkable in his original writings, as in the
tragedy of Bussy d'Amboise, &amp;c. In a word, the nature of the man may
account for his whole performance; for he appears, from his preface and
remarks, to have been of an arrogant turn, and an enthusiast in poetry.
His own boast, of having finished half the Iliad in less than fifteen
weeks, shows with what negligence his version was performed. But that
which is to be allowed him, and which very much contributed to cover
his defects, is a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation,
which is something like what one might imagine Homer himself would have
writ before he arrived at years of discretion.</p>

<p>Hobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in general; but
for particulars and circumstances he continually lops them, and often
omits the most beautiful. As for its being esteemed a close
translation, I doubt not many have been led into that error by the
shortness of it, which proceeds not from his following the original
line by line, but from the contractions above mentioned. He sometimes
omits whole similes and sentences; and is now and then guilty of
mistakes, into which no writer of his learning could have fallen, but
through carelessness. His poetry, as well as Ogilby's, is too mean for
criticism.</p>

<p>It is a great loss to the poetical world that Mr. Dryden did not live
to translate the Iliad. He has left us only the first book, and a small
part of the sixth; in which if he has in some places not truly
interpreted the sense, or preserved the antiquities, it ought to be
excused on account of the haste he was obliged to write in. He seems to
have had too much regard to Chapman, whose words he sometimes copies,
and has unhappily followed him in passages where he wanders from the
original. However, had he translated the whole work, I would no more
have attempted Homer after him than Virgil: his version of whom
(notwithstanding some human errors) is the most noble and spirited
translation I know in any language. But the fate of great geniuses is
like<pb n="xlv" /><anchor id="Pgxlv" /> that of great ministers: though they are confessedly the first in
the commonwealth of letters, they must be envied and calumniated only
for being at the head of it.</p>

<p>That which, in my opinion, ought to be the endeavour of any one who
translates Homer, is above all things to keep alive that spirit and
fire which makes his chief character: in particular places, where the
sense can bear any doubt, to follow the strongest and most poetical, as
most agreeing with that character; to copy him in all the variations of
his style, and the different modulations of his numbers; to preserve,
in the more active or descriptive parts, a warmth and elevation; in the
more sedate or narrative, a plainness and solemnity; in the speeches, a
fulness and perspicuity; in the sentences, a shortness and gravity; not
to neglect even the little figures and turns on the words, nor
sometimes the very cast of the periods; neither to omit nor confound
any rites or customs of antiquity: perhaps too he ought to include the
whole in a shorter compass than has hitherto been done by any
translator who has tolerably preserved either the sense or poetry. What
I would further recommend to him is, to study his author rather from
his own text, than from any commentaries, how learned soever, or
whatever figure they may make in the estimation of the world; to
consider him attentively in comparison with Virgil above all the
ancients, and with Milton above all the moderns. Next these, the
Archbishop of Cambray's Telemachus may give him the truest idea of the
spirit and turn of our author; and Bossu's admirable Treatise of the
Epic Poem the justest notion of his design and conduct. But after all,
with whatever judgment and study a man may proceed, or with whatever
happiness he may perform such a work, he must hope to please but a few;
those only who have at once a taste of poetry, and competent learning.
For to satisfy such a want either, is not in the nature of this
undertaking; since a mere modern wit can like nothing that is not
modern, and a pedant nothing that is not Greek.</p>

<p>What I have done is submitted to the public; from whose opinions I am
prepared to learn; though I fear no judges so little as our best poets,
who are most sensible of the weight of this task. As for the worst,
whatever they shall please to say, they may give me some concern as
they are unhappy men, but none as they are malignant writers. I was
guided in this translation by judgments very different from theirs, and
by persons for whom they can have no kindness, if an old observation be
true, that the strongest antipathy in the world is that of fools to men
of wit. Mr. Addison was the first whose advice determined me to
undertake this task; who was pleased to write to me upon that occasion
in such terms as I cannot repeat without vanity. I was obliged to Sir
Richard Steele for a very early recommendation of my undertaking to the
public. Dr. Swift promoted my interest with that warmth with which he
always serves his friend. The humanity and frankness of Sir Samuel
Garth are what I never knew wanting on any occasion. I must also
acknowledge, with infinite pleasure, the many friendly offices, as well
as sincere criticisms, of Mr. Congreve, who had led me the way in
translating some parts of Homer. I must add the names of Mr. Rowe, and
Dr. Parnell, though I shall take a further opportunity of doing justice
to the last, whose good nature (to<pb n="xlvi" /><anchor id="Pgxlvi" /> give it a great panegyric), is no
less extensive than his learning. The favour of these gentlemen is not
entirely undeserved by one who bears them so true an affection. But
what can I say of the honour so many of the great have done me; while
the first names of the age appear as my subscribers, and the most
distinguished patrons and ornaments of learning as my chief
encouragers? Among these it is a particular pleasure to me to find,
that my highest obligations are to such who have done most honour to
the name of poet: that his grace the Duke of Buckingham was not
displeased I should undertake the author to whom he has given (in his
excellent Essay), so complete a praise:</p>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Homer will be all the books you need."</l>
</lg>

<p>That the Earl of Halifax was one of the first to favour me; of whom it
is hard to say whether the advancement of the polite arts is more owing
to his generosity or his example: that such a genius as my Lord
Bolingbroke, not more distinguished in the great scenes of business,
than in all the useful and entertaining parts of learning, has not
refused to be the critic of these sheets, and the patron of their
writer: and that the noble author of the tragedy of "Heroic Love" has
continued his partiality to me, from my writing pastorals to my
attempting the Iliad. I cannot deny myself the pride of confessing,
that I have had the advantage not only of their advice for the conduct
in general, but their correction of several particulars of this
translation.</p>

<p>I could say a great deal of the pleasure of being distinguished by the
Earl of Carnarvon; but it is almost absurd to particularize any one
generous action in a person whose whole life is a continued series of
them. Mr. Stanhope, the present secretary of state, will pardon my
desire of having it known that he was pleased to promote this affair.
The particular zeal of Mr. Harcourt (the son of the late Lord
Chancellor) gave me a proof how much I am honoured in a share of his
friendship. I must attribute to the same motive that of several others
of my friends: to whom all acknowledgments are rendered unnecessary by
the privileges of a familiar correspondence; and I am satisfied I can
no way better oblige men of their turn than by my silence.</p>

<p>In short, I have found more patrons than ever Homer wanted. He would
have thought himself happy to have met the same favour at Athens that
has been shown me by its learned rival, the University of Oxford. And I
can hardly envy him those pompous honours he received after death, when
I reflect on the enjoyment of so many agreeable obligations, and easy
friendships, which make the satisfaction of life. This distinction is
the more to be acknowledged, as it is shown to one whose pen has never
gratified the prejudices of particular parties, or the vanities of
particular men. Whatever the success may prove, I shall never repent of
an undertaking in which I have experienced the candour and friendship
of so many persons of merit; and in which I hope to pass some of those
years of youth that are generally lost in a circle of follies, after a
manner neither wholly unuseful to others, nor disagreeable to myself.</p>

<p>ARGUMENT.<note place="foot"><p>The following argument of the Iliad, corrected in
a few particulars, is translated from Bitaube, and is, perhaps, the
neatest summary that has ever been drawn up:—"A hero, injured by his
general, and animated with a noble resentment, retires to his tent; and
for a season withdraws himself and his troops from the war. During this
interval, victory abandons the army, which for nine years has been
occupied in a great enterprise, upon the successful termination of
which the honour of their country depends. The general, at length
opening his eyes to the fault which he had committed, deputes the
principal officers of his army to the incensed hero, with commission to
make compensation for the injury, and to tender magnificent presents.
The hero, according to the proud obstinacy of his character, persists
in his animosity; the army is again defeated, and is on the verge of
entire destruction. This inexorable man has a friend; this friend weeps
before him, and asks for the hero's arms, and for permission to go to
the war in his stead. The eloquence of friendship prevails more than
the intercession of the ambassadors or the gifts of the general. He
lends his armour to his friend, but commands him not to engage with the
chief of the enemy's army, because he reserves to himself the honour of
that combat, and because he also fears for his friend's life. The
prohibition is forgotten; the friend listens to nothing but his
courage; his corpse is brought back to the hero, and the hero's arms
become the prize of the conqueror. Then the hero, given up to the most
lively despair, prepares to fight; he receives from a divinity new
armour, is reconciled with his general and, thirsting for glory and
revenge, enacts prodigies of valour, recovers the victory, slays the
enemy's chief, honours his friend with superb funeral rites, and
exercises a cruel vengeance on the body of his destroyer; but finally
appeased by the tears and prayers of the father of the slain warrior,
restores to the old man the corpse of his son, which he buries with due
solemnities.'—Coleridge, p. 177, sqq.</p></note></p>

<p>THE CONTENTION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.</p>

<p>In the war of Troy, the Greeks having sacked some of the neighbouring
towns, and taken from thence two beautiful captives, Chryseis and
Briseis, allotted the first to Agamemnon, and the last to Achilles.
Chryses, the father of Chryseis, and priest of Apollo, comes to the
Grecian camp to ransom her; with which the action of the poem opens, in
the tenth year of the siege. The priest being refused, and insolently
dismissed by Agamemnon, entreats for vengeance from his god; who
inflicts a pestilence on the Greeks. Achilles calls a council, and
encourages Chalcas to declare the cause of it; who attributes it to the
refusal of Chryseis. The king, being obliged to send back his captive,
enters into a furious contest with Achilles, which Nestor pacifies;
however, as he had the absolute command of the army, he seizes on
Briseis in revenge. Achilles in discontent withdraws himself and his
forces from the rest of the Greeks; and complaining to Thetis, she
supplicates Jupiter to render them sensible of the wrong done to her
son, by giving victory to the Trojans. Jupiter, granting her suit,
incenses Juno: between whom the debate runs high, till they are
reconciled by the address of Vulcan.</p>

<p>The time of two-and-twenty days is taken up in this book: nine during
the plague, one in the council and quarrel of the princes, and twelve
for Jupiter's stay with the Æthiopians, at whose return Thetis prefers
her petition. The scene lies in the Grecian camp, then changes to
Chrysa, and lastly to Olympus.</p>

the young child or promising adult, cut off in the germ of infancy or
flower of youth, of the old man dropping peacefully into the grave, or
of the reckless sinner suddenly checked in his career of crime, are
ascribed to the arrows of Apollo or Diana. The oracular functions of
the god rose naturally out of the above fundamental attributes, for who
could more appropriately impart to mortals what little foreknowledge
Fate permitted of her decrees than the agent of her most awful
dispensations? The close union of the arts of prophecy and song
explains his additional office of god of music, while the arrows with
which he and his sister were armed, symbols of sudden death in every
age, no less naturally procured him that of god of archery. Of any

sacred ship so often represented on Egyptian monuments, and the return
of the deity from Ethiopia after some days' absence, serves to show the
Ethiopian origin of Thebes, and of the worship of Jupiter Ammon. "I
think," says Heeren, after quoting a passage from Diodorus about the
holy ship, "that this procession is represented in one of the great
sculptured reliefs on the temple of Karnak. The sacred ship of Ammon is
on the shore with its whole equipment, and is towed along by another
boat. It is therefore on its voyage. This must have been one of the
most celebrated festivals, since, even according to the interpretation
of antiquity, Homer alludes to it when he speaks of Jupiter's visit to
the Ethiopians, and his twelve days' absence."—Long, "Egyptian
Antiquities" vol. 1 p. 96. Eustathius, vol. 1 p. 98, sq. (ed. Basil)
gives this interpretation, and likewise an allegorical one, which we
will spare the reader.</p></note></l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE TRIAL OF THE ARMY, AND CATALOGUE OF THE FORCES.</p>

<p>Jupiter, in pursuance of the request of Thetis, sends a deceitful
vision to Agamemnon, persuading him to lead the army to battle, in
order to make the Greeks sensible of their want of Achilles. The
general, who is deluded with the hopes of taking Troy without his
assistance, but fears the army was discouraged by his absence, and the
late plague, as well as by the length of time, contrives to make trial
of their disposition by a stratagem. He first communicates his design
to the princes in council, that he would propose a return to the
soldiers, and that they should put a stop to them if the proposal
was embraced. Then he assembles the whole host, and upon moving for a
return to Greece, they unanimously agree to it, and run to prepare the
ships. They are detained by the management of Ulysses, who chastises
the insolence of Thersites. The assembly is recalled, several speeches
made on the occasion, and at length the advice of Nestor followed,
which was to make a general muster of the troops, and to divide them
into their several nations, before they proceeded to battle. This gives
occasion to the poet to enumerate all the forces of the Greeks and
Trojans, and in a large catalogue.</p>

<p>The time employed in this book consists not entirely of one day. The
scene lies in the Grecian camp, and upon the sea-shore; towards the end
it removes to Troy.</p>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now pleasing sleep had seal'd each mortal eye,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stretch'd in the tents the Grecian leaders lie:</l>

deception of Jupiter's, and at his other attacks on the character of
the gods, that he would fain sentence him to an honourable banishment.
(See Minucius Felix, Section 22.) Coleridge, Introd. p. 154, well
observes, that the supreme father of gods and men had a full right to
employ a lying spirit to work out his ultimate will. Compare "Paradise
Lost," v. 646:</p>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce from his seat at this Ulysses springs,<note place="foot"><p>It may be remarked, that the character of Thersites,
revolting and contemptible as it is, serves admirably to develop the
disposition of Ulysses in a new light, in which mere cunning is less
prominent. Of the gradual and individual development of Homer's heroes,
Schlegel well observes, "In bas-relief the figures are usually in
profile, and in the epos all are characterized in the simplest manner
in relief; they are not grouped together, but follow one another; so
Homer's heroes advance, one by one, in succession before us. It has
been remarked that the <hi rend="font-style: italic">Iliad</hi> is not definitively closed, but
that we are left to suppose something both to precede and to follow it.
The bas-relief is equally without limit, and may be continued <hi rend="font-style: italic">ad
infinitum,</hi> either from before or behind, on which account the
ancients preferred for it such subjects as admitted of an indefinite
extension, sacrificial processions, dances, and lines of combatants,
and hence they also exhibit bas-reliefs on curved surfaces, such as
vases, or the frieze of a rotunda, where, by the curvature, the two
ends are withdrawn from our sight, and where, while we advance, one
object appears as another disappears. Reading Homer is very much like
such a circuit; the present object alone arresting our attention, we
lose sight of what precedes, and do not concern ourselves about what is
to follow."—"Dramatic Literature," p. 75.</p></note></l>

Thersites; while the unpopularity of such a character is attested even
more by the excessive pains which Homer takes to heap upon him
repulsive personal deformities, than by the chastisement of Odysseus

were offerings for Neptune. A heifer, or a sheep, for Minerva. To Ceres
a sow was sacrificed, as an enemy to corn. The goat to Bacchus, because
he fed on vines. Diana was propitiated with a stag; and to Venus the
dove was consecrated. The infernal and evil deities were to be appeased
with black victims. The most acceptable of all sacrifices was the

rising, according to Strabo, on the highest part of Mount Ida, in the
same hill with the Granicus and the OEdipus, and falling into the sea
at Sigaeum; everything tends to identify it with Mendere, as Wood,
Rennell, and others maintain; the Mendere is 40 miles long, 300 feet
broad, deep in the time of flood, nearly dry in the summer. Dr. Clarke
successfully combats the opinion of those who make the Scamander to
have arisen from the springs of Bounabarshy, and traces the source of
the river to the highest mountain in the chain of Ida, now Kusdaghy;
receives the Simois in its course; towards its mouth it is very muddy,
and flows through marshes. Between the Scamander and Simois, Homer's
Troy is supposed to have stood: this river, according to Homer, was
called Xanthus by the gods, Scamander by men. The waters of the
Scamander had the singular property of giving a beautiful colour to the
hair or wool of such animals as bathed in them; hence the three
goddesses, Minerva, Juno, and Venus, bathed there before they appeared
before Paris to obtain the golden apple: the name Xanthus, "yellow,"
was given to the Scamander, from the peculiar colour of its waters,
still applicable to the Mendere, the yellow colour of whose waters
attracts the attention of travellers.</p></note></l>

<p rend="text-align: center">THE CATALOGUE OF THE SHIPS.<note place="foot"><p>"The Catalogue is, perhaps, the
portion of the poem in favour of which a claim to separate authorship
has been most plausibly urged. Although the example of Homer has since
rendered some such formal enumeration of the forces engaged, a common
practice in epic poems descriptive of great warlike adventures, still
so minute a statistical detail can neither be considered as
imperatively required, nor perhaps such as would, in ordinary cases,
suggest itself to the mind of a poet. Yet there is scarcely any portion
of the Iliad where both historical and internal evidence are more
clearly in favour of a connection from the remotest period, with the
remainder of the work. The composition of the Catalogue, whensoever it
may have taken place, necessarily presumes its author's acquaintance
with a previously existing Iliad. It were impossible otherwise to
account for the harmony observable in the recurrence of so vast a
number of proper names, most of them historically unimportant, and not
a few altogether fictitious: or of so many geographical and
genealogical details as are condensed in these few hundred lines, and
incidentally scattered over the thousands which follow: equally
inexplicable were the pointed allusions occurring in this episode to
events narrated in the previous and subsequent text, several of which
could hardly be of traditional notoriety, but through the medium of the
Iliad."—Mure, "Language and Literature of Greece," vol. i. p. 263.</p></note></p>

vessels, which carried one hundred and twenty men each, were probably
meant to be the largest in the fleet, and those of Philoctetes,
carrying fifty each, the smallest. The average would be eighty-five,
and Thucydides supposes the troops to have rowed and navigated
themselves; and that very few, besides the chiefs, went as mere
passengers or landsmen. In short, we have in the Homeric descriptions
the complete picture of an Indian or African war canoe, many of
which are considerably larger than the largest scale assigned to those
of the Greeks. If the total number of the Greek ships be taken at
twelve hundred, according to Thucydides, although in point of fact
there are only eleven hundred and eighty-six in the Catalogue, the
amount of the army, upon the foregoing average, will be about a hundred
and two thousand men. The historian considers this a small force as
representing all Greece. Bryant, comparing it with the allied army at
Platae, thinks it so large as to prove the entire falsehood of the
whole story; and his reasonings and calculations are, for their
curiosity, well worth a careful perusal."—Coleridge, p. 211, sq.</p></note></l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE DUEL OF MENELAUS AND PARIS.</p>

<p>The armies being ready to engage, a single combat is agreed upon
between Menelaus and Paris (by the intervention of Hector) for the
determination of the war. Iris is sent to call Helen to behold the
fight. She leads her to the walls of Troy, where Priam sat with his
counsellers observing the Grecian leaders on the plain below, to whom
Helen gives an account of the chief of them. The kings on either part
take the solemn oath for the conditions of the combat. The duel ensues;
wherein Paris being overcome, he is snatched away in a cloud by Venus,
and transported to his apartment. She then calls Helen from the walls,
and brings the lovers together. Agamemnon, on the part of the Grecians,
demands the restoration of Helen, and the performance of the articles.</p>

<p>The three-and-twentieth day still continues throughout this book. The
scene is sometimes in the fields before Troy, and sometimes in Troy
itself.</p>


<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus by their leaders' care each martial band</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Moves into ranks, and stretches o'er the land.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With shouts the Trojans, rushing from afar,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Proclaim their motions, and provoke the war</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So when inclement winters vex the plain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With piercing frosts, or thick-descending rain,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift march the Greeks: the rapid dust around</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus from his flaggy wings when Notus sheds</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A night of vapours round the mountain heads,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift-gliding mists the dusky fields invade,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To thieves more grateful than the midnight shade;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While scarce the swains their feeding flocks survey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lost and confused amidst the thicken'd day:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So wrapp'd in gathering dust, the Grecian train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A moving cloud, swept on, and hid the plain.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now front to front the hostile armies stand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Eager of fight, and only wait command;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When, to the van, before the sons of fame</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whom Troy sent forth, the beauteous Paris came:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In form a god! the panther's speckled hide</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Flow'd o'er his armour with an easy pride:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His bended bow across his shoulders flung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His sword beside him negligently hung;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Two pointed spears he shook with gallant grace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And dared the bravest of the Grecian race.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As thus, with glorious air and proud disdain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He boldly stalk'd, the foremost on the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Him Menelaus, loved of Mars, espies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With heart elated, and with joyful eyes:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So joys a lion, if the branching deer,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or mountain goat, his bulky prize, appear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Eager he seizes and devours the slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Press'd by bold youths and baying dogs in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus fond of vengeance, with a furious bound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In clanging arms he leaps upon the ground</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From his high chariot: him, approaching near,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The beauteous champion views with marks of fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Smit with a conscious sense, retires behind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And shuns the fate he well deserved to find.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when some shepherd, from the rustling trees<note place="foot"><lg>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">When Greece beheld thy painted canvas flow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And crowds stood wondering at the passing show,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Say, was it thus, with such a baffled mien,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">You met the approaches of the Spartan queen,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus from her realm convey'd the beauteous prize,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And both her warlike lords outshined in Helen's eyes?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This deed, thy foes' delight, thy own disgrace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy father's grief, and ruin of thy race;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This deed recalls thee to the proffer'd fight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or hast thou injured whom thou dar'st not right?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon to thy cost the field would make thee know</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou keep'st the consort of a braver foe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy graceful form instilling soft desire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy curling tresses, and thy silver lyre,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beauty and youth; in vain to these you trust,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When youth and beauty shall be laid in dust:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Troy yet may wake, and one avenging blow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Crush the dire author of his country's woe."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His silence here, with blushes, Paris breaks:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"'Tis just, my brother, what your anger speaks:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But who like thee can boast a soul sedate,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So firmly proof to all the shocks of fate?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy force, like steel, a temper'd hardness shows,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still edged to wound, and still untired with blows,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like steel, uplifted by some strenuous swain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With falling woods to strew the wasted plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy gifts I praise; nor thou despise the charms</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With which a lover golden Venus arms;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soft moving speech, and pleasing outward show,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No wish can gain them, but the gods bestow.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet, would'st thou have the proffer'd combat stand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greeks and Trojans seat on either hand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then let a midway space our hosts divide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, on that stage of war, the cause be tried:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By Paris there the Spartan king be fought,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For beauteous Helen and the wealth she brought;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And who his rival can in arms subdue,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His be the fair, and his the treasure too.</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said. The challenge Hector heard with joy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then with his spear restrain'd the youth of Troy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Held by the midst, athwart; and near the foe</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Advanced with steps majestically slow:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While round his dauntless head the Grecians pour</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their stones and arrows in a mingled shower.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then thus the monarch, great Atrides, cried:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Forbear, ye warriors! lay the darts aside:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A parley Hector asks, a message bears;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">We know him by the various plume he wears."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Awed by his high command the Greeks attend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The tumult silence, and the fight suspend.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While from the centre Hector rolls his eyes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On either host, and thus to both applies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Hear, all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What Paris, author of the war, demands.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Your shining swords within the sheath restrain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And pitch your lances in the yielding plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Here in the midst, in either army's sight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He dares the Spartan king to single fight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And wills that Helen and the ravish'd spoil,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That caused the contest, shall reward the toil.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let these the brave triumphant victor grace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And different nations part in leagues of peace."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke: in still suspense on either side</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each army stood: the Spartan chief replied:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Me too, ye warriors, hear, whose fatal right</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A world engages in the toils of fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To me the labour of the field resign;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Me Paris injured; all the war be mine.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fall he that must, beneath his rival's arms;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The nations hear with rising hopes possess'd,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next, all unbuckling the rich mail they wore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Laid their bright arms along the sable shore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On either side the meeting hosts are seen</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Against the manlike Amazons we stood,<note place="foot"><p>The early epic was largely occupied with the exploits and
sufferings of women, or heroines, the wives and daughters of the
Grecian heroes. A nation of courageous, hardy, indefatigable women,
dwelling apart from men, permitting only a short temporary intercourse,
for the purpose of renovating their numbers, burning out their right
breast with a view of enabling themselves to draw the bow freely; this
was at once a general type, stimulating to the fancy of the poet, and a
theme eminently popular with his hearers. We find these warlike females
constantly reappearing in the ancient poems, and universally accepted
as past realities in the Iliad. When Priam wishes to illustrate
emphatically the most numerous host in which he ever found himself
included, he tells us that it was assembled in Phrygia, on the banks of
the Sangarius, for the purpose of resisting the formidable Amazons.
When Bellerophon is to be employed in a deadly and perilous
undertaking, by those who prudently wished to procure his death, he is
despatched against the Amazons.—Grote, vol. i p. 289.</p></note></l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE BREACH OF THE TRUCE, AND THE FIRST BATTLE.</p>

<p>The gods deliberate in council concerning the Trojan war: they agree
upon the continuation of it, and Jupiter sends down Minerva to break
the truce. She persuades Pandarus to aim an arrow at Menelaus, who is
wounded, but cured by Machaon. In the meantime some of the Trojan
troops attack the Greeks. Agamemnon is distinguished in all the parts
of a good general; he reviews the troops, and exhorts the leaders, some
by praises and others by reproof. Nestor is particularly celebrated for
his military discipline. The battle joins, and great numbers are slain
on both sides.</p>

<p>The same day continues through this as through the last book (as it
does also through the two following, and almost to the end of the
seventh book). The scene is wholly in the field before Troy.</p>


<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now Olympus' shining gates unfold;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gods, with Jove, assume their thrones of gold:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Immortal Hebe, fresh with bloom divine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The golden goblet crowns with purple wine:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While the full bowls flow round, the powers employ</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their careful eyes on long-contended Troy.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When Jove, disposed to tempt Saturnia's spleen,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus waked the fury of his partial queen,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Two powers divine the son of Atreus aid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Imperial Juno, and the martial maid;<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">The martial maid.</hi> In the original, "Minerva

<l rend="margin-left: 2">But high in heaven they sit, and gaze from far,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The tame spectators of his deeds of war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not thus fair Venus helps her favour'd knight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The queen of pleasures shares the toils of fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each danger wards, and constant in her care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Saves in the moment of the last despair.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her act has rescued Paris' forfeit life,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though great Atrides gain'd the glorious strife.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then say, ye powers! what signal issue waits</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To crown this deed, and finish all the fates!</l>
<pb n="068" /><anchor id="Pg068" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall Heaven by peace the bleeding kingdoms spare,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or rouse the furies, and awake the war?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet, would the gods for human good provide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Atrides soon might gain his beauteous bride,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still Priam's walls in peaceful honours grow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And through his gates the crowding nations flow."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus while he spoke, the queen of heaven, enraged,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And queen of war, in close consult engaged:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Apart they sit, their deep designs employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And meditate the future woes of Troy.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though secret anger swell'd Minerva's breast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The prudent goddess yet her wrath suppress'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Juno, impotent of passion, broke</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her sullen silence, and with fury spoke:</l>

originally a god, or whether he was first a man and then became
afterwards a god; but Apollodorus professed to fix the exact date of
his apotheosis. Throughout all the historical ages the descendants of
Asklepius were numerous and widely diffused. The many families or
gentes, called Asklepiads, who devoted themselves to the study and
practice of medicine, and who principally dwelt near the temples of
Asklepius, whither sick and suffering men came to obtain relief—all
recognized the god not merely as the object of their common worship,

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE ACTS OF DIOMED.</p>

<p>Diomed, assisted by Pallas, performs wonders in this day's battle.
Pandarus wounds him with an arrow, but the goddess cures him, enables
him to discern gods from mortals, and prohibits him from contending
with any of the former, excepting Venus. Æneas joins Pandarus to
oppose him; Pandarus is killed, and Æneas in great danger but for the
assistance of Venus; who, as she is removing her son from the fight, is
wounded on the hand by Diomed. Apollo seconds her in his rescue, and at
length carries off Æneas to Troy, where he is healed in the temple of
Pergamus. Mars rallies the Trojans, and assists Hector to make a stand.
In the meantime Æneas is restored to the field, and they overthrow
several of the Greeks; among the rest Tlepolemus is slain by Sarpedon.
Juno and Minerva descend to resist Mars; the latter incites Diomed to
go against that god; he wounds him, and sends him groaning to heaven.</p>

<p>The first battle continues through this book. The scene is the same as
in the former.</p>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce for renown the brother-chiefs draw near,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Seized with unusual fear, Idaeus fled,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Left the rich chariot, and his brother dead.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shook with his fall his brazen armour rung,</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE EPISODES OF GLAUCUS AND DIOMED, AND OF HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE.</p>

<p>The gods having left the field, the Grecians prevail. Helenus, the
chief augur of Troy, commands Hector to return to the city, in order to
appoint a solemn procession of the queen and the Trojan matrons to the
temple of Minerva, to entreat her to remove Diomed from the fight. The
battle relaxing during the absence of Hector, Glaucus and Diomed have
an interview between the two armies; where, coming to the knowledge, of
the friendship and hospitality passed between their ancestors, they
make exchange of their arms. Hector, having performed the orders of
Helenus, prevails upon Paris to return to the battle, and, taking a
tender leave of his wife Andromache, hastens again to the field.</p>

<p>The scene is first in the field of battle, between the rivers Simois
and Scamander, and then changes to Troy.</p>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now heaven forsakes the fight: the immortals yield</l>

reference also to the metals, it deserves to be remarked, that the

employed for arms, both offensive and defensive. By what process the

poet's method of introducing his episode, also, illustrates in a
curious manner his tact in the dramatic department of his art. Where,
for example, one or more heroes are despatched on some commission, to
be executed at a certain distance of time or place, the fulfilment of
this task is not, as a general rule, immediately described. A certain
interval is allowed them for reaching the appointed scene of action,
which interval is dramatised, as it were, either by a temporary
continuation of the previous narrative, or by fixing attention for a
while on some new transaction, at the close of which the further
account of the mission is resumed."</p></note></l>

irregular burst of popular indignation to which Hector alludes, when he
regrets that the Trojans had not spirit enough to cover Paris with a
mantle of stones. This, however, was also one of the ordinary formal
modes of punishment for great public offences. It may have been
originally connected with the same feeling—the desire of avoiding the
pollution of bloodshed—which seems to have suggested the practice of
burying prisoners alive, with a scantling of food by their side. Though
Homer makes no mention of this horrible usage, the example of the Roman
Vestals affords reasons for believing that, in ascribing it to the
heroic ages, Sophocles followed an authentic tradition."—Thirlwall's

he dwells on their metallic ornaments that the higher beauty of
proportion was but little required or understood, and it is, perhaps,
strength and convenience, rather than elegance, that he means to
commend, in speaking of the fair house which Paris had built for

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus having spoke, the illustrious chief of Troy</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stretch'd his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy.</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, and fondly gazing on her charms,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">She mingled with a smile a tender tear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The soften'd chief with kind compassion view'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And dried the falling drops, and thus pursued:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus having said, the glorious chief resumes</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">His princess parts with a prophetic sigh,</l>

<p>ARGUMENT</p>

<p>THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.</p>

<p>The battle renewing with double ardour upon the return of Hector,
Minerva is under apprehensions for the Greeks. Apollo, seeing her
descend from Olympus, joins her near the Scaean gate. They agree to put
off the general engagement for that day, and incite Hector to challenge
the Greeks to a single combat. Nine of the princes accepting the
challenge, the lot is cast and falls upon Ajax. These heroes, after
several attacks, are parted by the night. The Trojans calling a
council, Antenor purposes the delivery of Helen to the Greeks, to which
Paris will not consent, but offers to restore them her riches. Priam
sends a herald to make this offer, and to demand a truce for burning
the dead, the last of which only is agreed to by Agamemnon. When the
funerals are performed, the Greeks, pursuant to the advice of Nestor,
erect a fortification to protect their fleet and camp, flanked with
towers, and defended by a ditch and palisades. Neptune testifies his
jealousy at this work, but is pacified by a promise from Jupiter. Both
armies pass the night in feasting but Jupiter disheartens the Trojans
with thunder, and other signs of his wrath.</p>

<p>The three and twentieth day ends with the duel of Hector and Ajax, the
next day the truce is agreed; another is taken up in the funeral rites
of the slain and one more in building the fortification before the
ships. So that somewhat about three days is employed in this book. The
scene lies wholly in the field.</p>


<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So spoke the guardian of the Trojan state,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then rush'd impetuous through the Scaean gate.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Him Paris follow'd to the dire alarms;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Both breathing slaughter, both resolved in arms.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when to sailors labouring through the main,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That long have heaved the weary oar in vain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove bids at length the expected gales arise;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gales blow grateful, and the vessel flies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So welcome these to Troy's desiring train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bands are cheer'd, the war awakes again.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bold Paris first the work of death begun</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On great Menestheus, Areithous' son,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sprung from the fair Philomeda's embrace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The pleasing Arne was his native place.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then sunk Eioneus to the shades below,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath his steely casque he felt the blow<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Casque.</hi> The original word is stephanae, about the
meaning of which there is some little doubt. Some take it for a
different kind of cap or helmet, others for the rim, others for the
cone, of the helmet.</p></note></l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on his neck, from Hector's weighty hand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And roll'd, with limbs relax'd, along the land.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By Glaucus' spear the bold Iphmous bleeds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fix'd in the shoulder as he mounts his steeds;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Headlong he tumbles: his slack nerves unbound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Drop the cold useless members on the ground.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When now Minerva saw her Argives slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From vast Olympus to the gleaming plain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce she descends: Apollo marked her flight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor shot less swift from Ilion's towery height.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Radiant they met, beneath the beechen shade;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When thus Apollo to the blue-eyed maid:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What cause, O daughter of Almighty Jove!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus wings thy progress from the realms above?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Once more impetuous dost thou bend thy way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To give to Greece the long divided day?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Too much has Troy already felt thy hate,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now breathe thy rage, and hush the stern debate;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This day, the business of the field suspend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">War soon shall kindle, and great Ilion bend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Since vengeful goddesses confederate join</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To raze her walls, though built by hands divine."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To whom the progeny of Jove replies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"I left, for this, the council of the skies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But who shall bid conflicting hosts forbear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What art shall calm the furious sons of war?"</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To her the god: "Great Hector's soul incite</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To dare the boldest Greek to single fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till Greece, provoked, from all her numbers show</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A warrior worthy to be Hector's foe."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At this agreed, the heavenly powers withdrew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sage Helenus their secret counsels knew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hector, inspired, he sought: to him address'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus told the dictates of his sacred breast:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O son of Priam! let thy faithful ear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Receive my words: thy friend and brother hear!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Go forth persuasive, and a while engage</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warring nations to suspend their rage;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then dare the boldest of the hostile train</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To mortal combat on the listed plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For not this day shall end thy glorious date;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gods have spoke it, and their voice is fate."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said: the warrior heard the word with joy;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then with his spear restrain'd the youth of Troy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Held by the midst athwart. On either hand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The squadrons part; the expecting Trojans stand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Agamemnon bids the Greeks forbear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They breathe, and hush the tumult of the war.</l>

<pb n="129" /><anchor id="Pg129" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With silent joy the settling hosts survey:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In form of vultures, on the beech's height</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They sit conceal'd, and wait the future fight.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The thronging troops obscure the dusky fields,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Horrid with bristling spears, and gleaming shields.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when a general darkness veils the main,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Soft Zephyr curling the wide wat'ry plain,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The waves scarce heave, the face of ocean sleeps,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And a still horror saddens all the deeps;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus in thick orders settling wide around,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At length composed they sit, and shade the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Hector first amidst both armies broke</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The solemn silence, and their powers bespoke:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Hear, all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What my soul prompts, and what some god commands.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Jove, averse our warfare to compose,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'erwhelms the nations with new toils and woes;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">War with a fiercer tide once more returns,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till Ilion falls, or till yon navy burns.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">You then, O princes of the Greeks! appear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis Hector speaks, and calls the gods to hear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From all your troops select the boldest knight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And him, the boldest, Hector dares to fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Here if I fall, by chance of battle slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Be his my spoil, and his these arms remain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But let my body, to my friends return'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By Trojan hands and Trojan flames be burn'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And if Apollo, in whose aid I trust,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall stretch your daring champion in the dust;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If mine the glory to despoil the foe;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On Phoebus' temple I'll his arms bestow:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The breathless carcase to your navy sent,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Greece on the shore shall raise a monument;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which when some future mariner surveys,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wash'd by broad Hellespont's resounding seas,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus shall he say, 'A valiant Greek lies there,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By Hector slain, the mighty man of war,'</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The stone shall tell your vanquish'd hero's name.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And distant ages learn the victor's fame."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This fierce defiance Greece astonish'd heard,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Blush'd to refuse, and to accept it fear'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stern Menelaus first the silence broke,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, inly groaning, thus opprobrious spoke:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Women of Greece! O scandal of your race,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose coward souls your manly form disgrace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How great the shame, when every age shall know</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That not a Grecian met this noble foe!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Go then! resolve to earth, from whence ye grew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A heartless, spiritless, inglorious crew!</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">But in the hands of God is victory."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These words scarce spoke, with generous ardour press'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His manly limbs in azure arms he dress'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That day, Atrides! a superior hand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Had stretch'd thee breathless on the hostile strand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But all at once, thy fury to compose,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The kings of Greece, an awful band, arose;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even he their chief, great Agamemnon, press'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy daring hand, and this advice address'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Whither, O Menelaus! wouldst thou run,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And tempt a fate which prudence bids thee shun?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Grieved though thou art, forbear the rash design;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Hectors arm is mightier far than thine:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even fierce Achilles learn'd its force to fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And trembling met this dreadful son of war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sit thou secure, amidst thy social band;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Greece in our cause shall arm some powerful hand.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The mightiest warrior of the Achaian name,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though bold and burning with desire of fame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Content the doubtful honour might forego,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So great the danger, and so brave the foe."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said, and turn'd his brother's vengeful mind;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He stoop'd to reason, and his rage resign'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No longer bent to rush on certain harms;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His joyful friends unbrace his azure arms.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He from whose lips divine persuasion flows,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Grave Nestor, then, in graceful act arose;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus to the kings he spoke: "What grief, what shame</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Attend on Greece, and all the Grecian name!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How shall, alas! her hoary heroes mourn</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oh! would to all the immortal powers above,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Minerva, Phoebus, and almighty Jove!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Years might again roll back, my youth renew,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">When fierce in war, where Jardan's waters fall,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To sacred Troy, where all her princes lay</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To wait the event, the herald bent his way.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Straight to their several cares the Trojans move,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through heaps of carnage search'd the mournful plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Scarce could the friend his slaughter'd friend explore,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bodies decent on the piles were placed:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With melting hearts the cold remains they burn'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, sadly slow, to sacred Troy return'd.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The doubtful confines of the day and night,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">About the dying flames the Greeks appear'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And round the pile a general tomb they rear'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, to secure the camp and naval powers,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They raised embattled walls with lofty towers:<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Embattled walls.</hi> "Another essential basis of mechanical
unity in the poem is the construction of the rampart. This takes place
in the seventh book. The reason ascribed for the glaring improbability
that the Greeks should have left their camp and fleet unfortified
during nine years, in the midst of a hostile country, is a purely
poetical one: 'So long as Achilles fought, the terror of his name
sufficed to keep every foe at a distance.' The disasters consequent
on his secession first led to the necessity of other means of
protection. Accordingly, in the battles previous to the eighth book,
no allusion occurs to a rampart; in all those which follow it forms a
prominent feature. Here, then, in the anomaly as in the propriety of
the Iliad, the destiny of Achilles, or rather this peculiar crisis of
it, forms the pervading bond of connexion to the whole poem."—Mure,

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE SECOND BATTLE, AND THE DISTRESS OF THE GREEKS.</p>

<p>Jupiter assembles a council of the deities, and threatens them
with the pains of Tartarus if they assist either side: Minerva only
obtains of him that she may direct the Greeks by her counsels.<note place="foot"><p>"A similar bond of connexion, in the military details of the
narrative, is the decree issued by Jupiter, at the commencement of the
eighth book, against any further interference of the gods in the
battles. In the opening of the twentieth book this interdict is
withdrawn. During the twelve intermediate books it is kept steadily in
view. No interposition takes place but on the part of the specially
authorised agents of Jove, or on that of one or two contumacious
deities, described as boldly setting his commands at defiance, but
checked and reprimanded for their disobedience; while the other divine
warriors, who in the previous and subsequent cantos are so active in
support of their favourite heroes, repeatedly allude to the supreme
edict as the cause of their present inactivity."—Mure, vol. i. p 257.
See however, Muller, "Greek Literature," ch. v. Section 6, and Grote,
vol. ii. p. 252.</p></note>
his balances the fates of both, and affrights the Greeks with his
thunders and lightnings. Nestor alone continues in the field in great
danger: Diomed relieves him; whose exploits, and those of Hector, are
excellently described. Juno endeavours to animate Neptune to the
assistance of the Greeks, but in vain. The acts of Teucer, who is at
length wounded by Hector, and carried off. Juno and Minerva prepare to
aid the Grecians, but are restrained by Iris, sent from Jupiter. The
night puts an end to the battle. Hector continues in the field, (the
Greeks being driven to their fortifications before the ships,) and
gives orders to keep the watch all night in the camp, to prevent the
enemy from re-embarking and escaping by flight. They kindle fires
through all the fields, and pass the night under arms.</p>

<p>The time of seven and twenty days is employed from the opening of the
poem to the end of this book. The scene here (except of the celestial
machines) lies in the field towards the seashore.</p>

<p>"Some of the epithets which Homer applies to the heavens seem to imply
that he considered it as a solid vault of metal. But it is not
necessary to construe these epithets so literally, nor to draw any such
inference from his description of Atlas, who holds the lofty pillars
which keep earth and heaven asunder. Yet it would seem, from the
manner in which the height of heaven is compared with the depth of
Tartarus, that the region of light was thought to have certain bounds.
The summit of the Thessalian Olympus was regarded as the highest point
on the earth, and it is not always carefully distinguished from the
aerian regions above The idea of a seat of the gods—perhaps derived
from a more ancient tradition, in which it was not attached to any
geographical site—seems to be indistinctly blended in the poet's mind
with that of the real mountain."—Thirlwall's Greece, vol. i. p. 217,

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Another shaft the raging archer drew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That other shaft with erring fury flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(From Hector, Phoebus turn'd the flying wound,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet fell not dry or guiltless to the ground:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Guards as he turns, and circles as he wheels;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus oft the Grecians turn'd, but still they flew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus following, Hector still the hindmost slew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When flying they had pass'd the trench profound,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before the ships a desperate stand they made,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Haste, launch thy chariot, through yon ranks to ride;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Myself will arm, and thunder at thy side.</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.</p>

<p>Agamemnon, after the last day's defeat, proposes to the Greeks to quit
the siege, and return to their country. Diomed opposes this, and Nestor
seconds him, praising his wisdom and resolution. He orders the guard to
be strengthened, and a council summoned to deliberate what measures are
to be followed in this emergency. Agamemnon pursues this advice, and
Nestor further prevails upon him to send ambassadors to Achilles, in
order to move him to a reconciliation. Ulysses and Ajax are made choice
of, who are accompanied by old Phoenix. They make, each of them, very
moving and pressing speeches, but are rejected with roughness by
Achilles, who notwithstanding retains Phoenix in his tent. The
ambassadors return unsuccessfully to the camp, and the troops betake
themselves to sleep.</p>

<p>This book, and the next following, take up the space of one night,
which is the twenty-seventh from the beginning of the poem. The scene
lies on the sea-shore, the station of the Grecian ships.</p>


<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus joyful Troy maintain'd the watch of night;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While fear, pale comrade of inglorious flight,<note place="foot"><p>This flight of the Greeks, according to Buttmann, Lexil. p.
358, was not a supernatural flight caused by the gods, but "a great and
general one, caused by Hector and the Trojans, but with the approval of
Jove."</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And heaven-bred horror, on the Grecian part,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sat on each face, and sadden'd every heart.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As from its cloudy dungeon issuing forth,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A double tempest of the west and north</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swells o'er the sea, from Thracia's frozen shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heaps waves on waves, and bids the Ægean roar:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This way and that the boiling deeps are toss'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such various passions urged the troubled host,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Agamemnon grieved above the rest;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Superior sorrows swell'd his royal breast;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Himself his orders to the heralds bears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To bid to council all the Grecian peers,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But bid in whispers: these surround their chief,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In solemn sadness and majestic grief.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The king amidst the mournful circle rose:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Down his wan cheek a briny torrent flows.</l>
<pb n="160" /><anchor id="Pg160" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So silent fountains, from a rock's tall head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In sable streams soft-trickling waters shed.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With more than vulgar grief he stood oppress'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Words, mix'd with sighs, thus bursting from his breast:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Ye sons of Greece! partake your leader's care;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fellows in arms and princes of the war!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of partial Jove too justly we complain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And heavenly oracles believed in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A safe return was promised to our toils,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With conquest honour'd and enrich'd with spoils:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now shameful flight alone can save the host;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Our wealth, our people, and our glory lost.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So Jove decrees, almighty lord of all!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove, at whose nod whole empires rise or fall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who shakes the feeble props of human trust,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And towers and armies humbles to the dust.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Haste then, for ever quit these fatal fields,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Haste to the joys our native country yields;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Spread all your canvas, all your oars employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor hope the fall of heaven-defended Troy."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said: deep silence held the Grecian band;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Silent, unmov'd in dire dismay they stand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A pensive scene! till Tydeus' warlike son</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Roll'd on the king his eyes, and thus begun:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"When kings advise us to renounce our fame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">First let him speak who first has suffer'd shame.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If I oppose thee, prince! thy wrath withhold,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The laws of council bid my tongue be bold.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou first, and thou alone, in fields of fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Durst brand my courage, and defame my might:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor from a friend the unkind reproach appear'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greeks stood witness, all our army heard.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gods, O chief! from whom our honours spring,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gods have made thee but by halves a king:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They gave thee sceptres, and a wide command;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They gave dominion o'er the seas and land;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The noblest power that might the world control</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They gave thee not—a brave and virtuous soul.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Is this a general's voice, that would suggest</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fears like his own to every Grecian breast?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Confiding in our want of worth, he stands;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And if we fly, 'tis what our king commands.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Go thou, inglorious! from the embattled plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ships thou hast store, and nearest to the main;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A noble care the Grecians shall employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To combat, conquer, and extirpate Troy.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Here Greece shall stay; or, if all Greece retire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Myself shall stay, till Troy or I expire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Myself, and Sthenelus, will fight for fame;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">God bade us fight, and 'twas with God we came."</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And voice to voice resounds Tydides' praise.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke: the host in still attention heard:<note place="foot"><p>Grote, vol. ii. p. 91, after noticing the modest calmness

solely for his information and guidance."</p></note></l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O truly great! in whom the gods have join'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such strength of body with such force of mind:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In conduct, as in courage, you excel,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And yet those years that since thy birth have run</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Would hardly style thee Nestor's youngest son.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then let me add what yet remains behind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A thought unfinish'd in that generous mind;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Age bids me speak! nor shall the advice I bring</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Distaste the people, or offend the king:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Cursed is the man, and void of law and right,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unfit for public rule, or private care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That wretch, that monster, who delights in war;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose lust is murder, and whose horrid joy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To tear his country, and his kind destroy!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This night, refresh and fortify thy train;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great is thy sway, and weighty are thy cares;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy high commands must spirit all our wars.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With Thracian wines recruit thy honour'd guests,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For happy counsels flow from sober feasts.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wise, weighty counsels aid a state distress'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And such a monarch as can choose the best.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">See what a blaze from hostile tents aspires,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How near our fleet approach the Trojan fires!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who can, unmoved, behold the dreadful light?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What eye beholds them, and can close to-night?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This dreadful interval determines all;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To-morrow, Troy must flame, or Greece must fall."</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">If gifts immense his mighty soul can bow,<note place="foot"><p>In the heroic times, it is not unfrequent for the king to
receive presents to purchase freedom from his wrath, or immunity from
his exactions. Such gifts gradually became regular, and formed the
income of the German, (Tacit. Germ. Section 15) Persian, (Herodot.
iii.89), and other kings. So, too, in the middle ages, 'The feudal aids
are the beginning of taxation, of which they for a long time answered
the purpose.' (Hallam, Middle Ages, ch. x. pt. 1, p. 189) This fact
frees Achilles from the apparent charge of sordidness. Plato, however,
(De Rep. vi. 4), says, "We cannot commend Phoenix, the tutor of
Achilles, as if he spoke correctly, when counselling him to accept of
presents and assist the Greeks, but, without presents, not to desist
from his wrath, nor again, should we commend Achilles himself, or
approve of his being so covetous as to receive presents from
Agamemnon," &amp;c.</p></note></l>

in the Iliad, and small the part she plays—what little is said is
pre-eminently calculated to enhance her fitness to be the bride of

towns inhabited by wealthy husbandmen, who would enrich their lord by
presents and tribute, seems likewise to assume rather a property in

Phocis, but also other rivers from Parnassus and Helicon" (Grote, vol.
p. 181), was a sufficient reason for its prosperity and decay. "As
long as the channels of these waters were diligently watched and kept
clear, a large portion of the lake was in the condition of alluvial
land, pre-eminently rich and fertile. But when the channels came to be
either neglected, or designedly choked up by an enemy, the water
accumulated in such a degree as to occupy the soil of more than one
ancient islet, and to occasion the change of the site of Orchomenus
itself from the plain to the declivity of Mount Hyphanteion." (Ibid.)</p></note></l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE NIGHT-ADVENTURE OF DIOMED AND ULYSSES.</p>

<p>Upon the refusal of Achilles to return to the army, the distress of
Agamemnon is described in the most lively manner. He takes no rest that
night, but passes through the camp, awaking the leaders, and contriving
all possible methods for the public safety. Menelaus, Nestor, Ulysses,
and Diomed are employed in raising the rest of the captains. They call
a council of war, and determine to send scouts into the enemies' camp,
to learn their posture, and discover their intentions. Diomed
undertakes this hazardous enterprise, and makes choice of Ulysses for
his companion. In their passage they surprise Dolon, whom Hector had
sent on a like design to the camp of the Grecians. From him they are
informed of the situation of the Trojan and auxiliary forces, and
particularly of Rhesus, and the Thracians who were lately arrived. They
pass on with success; kill Rhesus, with several of his officers, and
seize the famous horses of that prince, with which they return in
triumph to the camp.</p>

<p>The same night continues; the scene lies in the two camps.</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All night the chiefs before their vessels lay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And lost in sleep the labours of the day:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All but the king: with various thoughts oppress'd,<note place="foot"><lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"All else of nature's common gift partake:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unhappy Dido was alone awake."</l>
</lg>

<p rend="text-align: right">—Dryden's Virgil, iv. 767.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His country's cares lay rolling in his breast.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when by lightnings Jove's ethereal power</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Foretels the rattling hail, or weighty shower,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or sends soft snows to whiten all the shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or bids the brazen throat of war to roar;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By fits one flash succeeds as one expires,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And heaven flames thick with momentary fires:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So bursting frequent from Atrides' breast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sighs following sighs his inward fears confess'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now o'er the fields, dejected, he surveys</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From thousand Trojan fires the mounting blaze;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hears in the passing wind their music blow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And marks distinct the voices of the foe.</l>
<pb n="181" /><anchor id="Pg181" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now looking backwards to the fleet and coast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Anxious he sorrows for the endangered host.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He rends his hair, in sacrifice to Jove,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sues to him that ever lives above:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Inly he groans; while glory and despair</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Divide his heart, and wage a double war.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A thousand cares his labouring breast revolves;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To seek sage Nestor now the chief resolves,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With him, in wholesome counsels, to debate</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What yet remains to save the afflicted state.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He rose, and first he cast his mantle round,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next on his feet the shining sandals bound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A lion's yellow spoils his back conceal'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His warlike hand a pointed javelin held.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meanwhile his brother, press'd with equal woes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Alike denied the gifts of soft repose,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Laments for Greece, that in his cause before</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So much had suffer'd and must suffer more.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A leopard's spotted hide his shoulders spread:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A brazen helmet glitter'd on his head:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus (with a javelin in his hand) he went</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To wake Atrides in the royal tent.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Already waked, Atrides he descried,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His armour buckling at his vessel's side.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Joyful they met; the Spartan thus begun:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Why puts my brother his bright armour on?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sends he some spy, amidst these silent hours,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To try yon camp, and watch the Trojan powers?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But say, what hero shall sustain that task?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such bold exploits uncommon courage ask;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Guideless, alone, through night's dark shade to go,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And midst a hostile camp explore the foe."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To whom the king: "In such distress we stand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No vulgar counsel our affairs demand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Greece to preserve, is now no easy part,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But asks high wisdom, deep design, and art.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For Jove, averse, our humble prayer denies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bows his head to Hector's sacrifice.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What eye has witness'd, or what ear believed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In one great day, by one great arm achieved,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such wondrous deeds as Hector's hand has done,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And we beheld, the last revolving sun</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What honours the beloved of Jove adorn!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sprung from no god, and of no goddess born;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet such his acts, as Greeks unborn shall tell,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And curse the battle where their fathers fell.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Now speed thy hasty course along the fleet,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There call great Ajax, and the prince of Crete;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ourself to hoary Nestor will repair;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">(For Nestor's influence best that quarter guides,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose son with Merion, o'er the watch presides.")</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To whom the Spartan: "These thy orders borne,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Say, shall I stay, or with despatch return?"</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"There shall thou stay, (the king of men replied,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Else may we miss to meet, without a guide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The paths so many, and the camp so wide.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still, with your voice the slothful soldiers raise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Urge by their fathers' fame their future praise.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forget we now our state and lofty birth;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not titles here, but works, must prove our worth.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To labour is the lot of man below;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And when Jove gave us life, he gave us woe."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This said, each parted to his several cares:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The king to Nestor's sable ship repairs;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sage protector of the Greeks he found</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stretch'd in his bed with all his arms around</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The various-colour'd scarf, the shield he rears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The shining helmet, and the pointed spears;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The dreadful weapons of the warrior's rage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That, old in arms, disdain'd the peace of age.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, leaning on his hand his watchful head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hoary monarch raised his eyes and said:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What art thou, speak, that on designs unknown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While others sleep, thus range the camp alone;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Seek'st thou some friend or nightly sentinel?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stand off, approach not, but thy purpose tell."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O son of Neleus, (thus the king rejoin'd,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pride of the Greeks, and glory of thy kind!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo, here the wretched Agamemnon stands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The unhappy general of the Grecian bands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whom Jove decrees with daily cares to bend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And woes, that only with his life shall end!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Scarce can my knees these trembling limbs sustain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And scarce my heart support its load of pain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No taste of sleep these heavy eyes have known,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Confused, and sad, I wander thus alone,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With fears distracted, with no fix'd design;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all my people's miseries are mine.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If aught of use thy waking thoughts suggest,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Since cares, like mine, deprive thy soul of rest,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Impart thy counsel, and assist thy friend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now let us jointly to the trench descend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At every gate the fainting guard excite,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tired with the toils of day and watch of night;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Else may the sudden foe our works invade,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So near, and favour'd by the gloomy shade."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To him thus Nestor: "Trust the powers above,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor think proud Hector's hopes confirm'd by Jove:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the wise counsels of the eternal mind!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Audacious Hector, if the gods ordain</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">What toils attend thee, and what woes remain!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo, faithful Nestor thy command obeys;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The care is next our other chiefs to raise:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ulysses, Diomed, we chiefly need;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meges for strength, Oileus famed for speed.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some other be despatch'd of nimbler feet,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To those tall ships, remotest of the fleet,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where lie great Ajax and the king of Crete.<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">The king of Crete:</hi> Idomeneus.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To rouse the Spartan I myself decree;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dear as he is to us, and dear to thee,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet must I tax his sloth, that claims no share</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With his great brother in his martial care:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Him it behoved to every chief to sue,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Preventing every part perform'd by you;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For strong necessity our toils demands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Claims all our hearts, and urges all our hands."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To whom the king: "With reverence we allow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy just rebukes, yet learn to spare them now:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My generous brother is of gentle kind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He seems remiss, but bears a valiant mind;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through too much deference to our sovereign sway,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Content to follow when we lead the way:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But now, our ills industrious to prevent,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Long ere the rest he rose, and sought my tent.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The chiefs you named, already at his call,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prepare to meet us near the navy-wall;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Assembling there, between the trench and gates,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Near the night-guards, our chosen council waits."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Then none (said Nestor) shall his rule withstand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For great examples justify command."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With that, the venerable warrior rose;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The shining greaves his manly legs enclose;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His purple mantle golden buckles join'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Warm with the softest wool, and doubly lined.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then rushing from his tent, he snatch'd in haste</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His steely lance, that lighten'd as he pass'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The camp he traversed through the sleeping crowd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stopp'd at Ulysses' tent, and call'd aloud.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ulysses, sudden as the voice was sent,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Awakes, starts up, and issues from his tent.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What new distress, what sudden cause of fright,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus leads you wandering in the silent night?"</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O prudent chief! (the Pylian sage replied)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wise as thou art, be now thy wisdom tried:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whatever means of safety can be sought,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whatever methods, or to fly or fight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All, all depend on this important night!"</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He heard, return'd, and took his painted shield;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then join'd the chiefs, and follow'd through the field.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Without his tent, bold Diomed they found,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All sheathed in arms, his brave companions round:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each sunk in sleep, extended on the field,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His head reclining on his bossy shield.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A wood of spears stood by, that, fix'd upright,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shot from their flashing points a quivering light.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A bull's black hide composed the hero's bed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A splendid carpet roll'd beneath his head.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, with his foot, old Nestor gently shakes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The slumbering chief, and in these words awakes:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Rise, son of Tydeus! to the brave and strong</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rest seems inglorious, and the night too long.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But sleep'st thou now, when from yon hill the foe</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hangs o'er the fleet, and shades our walls below?"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At this, soft slumber from his eyelids fled;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warrior saw the hoary chief, and said:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Wondrous old man! whose soul no respite knows,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though years and honours bid thee seek repose,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let younger Greeks our sleeping warriors wake;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ill fits thy age these toils to undertake."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"My friend, (he answered,) generous is thy care;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These toils, my subjects and my sons might bear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their loyal thoughts and pious love conspire</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To ease a sovereign and relieve a sire:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But now the last despair surrounds our host;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No hour must pass, no moment must be lost;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each single Greek, in this conclusive strife,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stands on the sharpest edge of death or life:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet, if my years thy kind regard engage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Employ thy youth as I employ my age;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Succeed to these my cares, and rouse the rest;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">This said, the hero o'er his shoulders flung</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A lion's spoils, that to his ankles hung;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then seized his ponderous lance, and strode along.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meges the bold, with Ajax famed for speed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warrior roused, and to the entrenchments lead.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now the chiefs approach the nightly guard;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A wakeful squadron, each in arms prepared:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The unwearied watch their listening leaders keep,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, couching close, repel invading sleep.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So faithful dogs their fleecy charge maintain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With toil protected from the prowling train;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When the gaunt lioness, with hunger bold,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Springs from the mountains toward the guarded fold:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through breaking woods her rustling course they hear;</l>
<pb n="185" /><anchor id="Pg185" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Loud, and more loud, the clamours strike their ear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of hounds and men: they start, they gaze around,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Watch every side, and turn to every sound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus watch'd the Grecians, cautious of surprise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each voice, each motion, drew their ears and eyes:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each step of passing feet increased the affright;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hostile Troy was ever full in sight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nestor with joy the wakeful band survey'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus accosted through the gloomy shade.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"'Tis well, my sons! your nightly cares employ;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Else must our host become the scorn of Troy.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Watch thus, and Greece shall live." The hero said;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then o'er the trench the following chieftains led.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His son, and godlike Merion, march'd behind</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(For these the princes to their council join'd).</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The trenches pass'd, the assembled kings around</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In silent state the consistory crown'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A place there was, yet undefiled with gore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The spot where Hector stopp'd his rage before;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When night descending, from his vengeful hand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Reprieved the relics of the Grecian band:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The plain beside with mangled corps was spread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all his progress mark'd by heaps of dead:)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There sat the mournful kings: when Neleus' son,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The council opening, in these words begun:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Is there (said he) a chief so greatly brave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His life to hazard, and his country save?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lives there a man, who singly dares to go</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To yonder camp, or seize some straggling foe?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or favour'd by the night approach so near,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their speech, their counsels, and designs to hear?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If to besiege our navies they prepare,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or Troy once more must be the seat of war?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This could he learn, and to our peers recite,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And pass unharm'd the dangers of the night;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What fame were his through all succeeding days,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Phoebus shines, or men have tongues to praise!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What gifts his grateful country would bestow!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What must not Greece to her deliverer owe?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A sable ewe each leader should provide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With each a sable lambkin by her side;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At every rite his share should be increased,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And his the foremost honours of the feast."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fear held them mute: alone, untaught to fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tydides spoke—"The man you seek is here.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through yon black camps to bend my dangerous way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some god within commands, and I obey.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But let some other chosen warrior join,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To raise my hopes, and second my design.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By mutual confidence and mutual aid,</l>
<pb n="186" /><anchor id="Pg186" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great deeds are done, and great discoveries made;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wise new prudence from the wise acquire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And one brave hero fans another's fire."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Contending leaders at the word arose;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each generous breast with emulation glows;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So brave a task each Ajax strove to share,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bold Merion strove, and Nestor's valiant heir;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Spartan wish'd the second place to gain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And great Ulysses wish'd, nor wish'd in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then thus the king of men the contest ends:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Thou first of warriors, and thou best of friends,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Undaunted Diomed! what chief to join</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In this great enterprise, is only thine.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Just be thy choice, without affection made;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To birth, or office, no respect be paid;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let worth determine here." The monarch spake,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And inly trembled for his brother's sake.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Then thus (the godlike Diomed rejoin'd)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My choice declares the impulse of my mind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How can I doubt, while great Ulysses stands</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To lend his counsels and assist our hands?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A chief, whose safety is Minerva's care;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So famed, so dreadful, in the works of war:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bless'd in his conduct, I no aid require;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wisdom like his might pass through flames of fire."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"It fits thee not, before these chiefs of fame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Replied the sage,) to praise me, or to blame:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Praise from a friend, or censure from a foe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Are lost on hearers that our merits know.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But let us haste—Night rolls the hours away,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The reddening orient shows the coming day,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The stars shine fainter on the ethereal plains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And of night's empire but a third remains."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus having spoke, with generous ardour press'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In arms terrific their huge limbs they dress'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A two-edged falchion Thrasymed the brave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And ample buckler, to Tydides gave:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then in a leathern helm he cased his head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Short of its crest, and with no plume o'erspread:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Such as by youths unused to arms are worn:)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No spoils enrich it, and no studs adorn.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next him Ulysses took a shining sword,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A bow and quiver, with bright arrows stored:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A well-proved casque, with leather braces bound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Thy gift, Meriones,) his temples crown'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soft wool within; without, in order spread,<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Soft wool within, i e.</hi> a kind of woollen stuffing,
pressed in between the straps, to protect the head, and make the helmet
fit close.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A boar's white teeth grinn'd horrid o'er his head.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This from Amyntor, rich Ormenus' son,</l>
<pb n="187" /><anchor id="Pg187" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Autolycus by fraudful rapine won,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gave Amphidamas; from him the prize</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Molus received, the pledge of social ties;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The helmet next by Merion was possess'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now Ulysses' thoughtful temples press'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus sheathed in arms, the council they forsake,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And dark through paths oblique their progress take.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Just then, in sign she favour'd their intent,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A long-wing'd heron great Minerva sent:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This, though surrounding shades obscured their view.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By the shrill clang and whistling wings they knew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As from the right she soar'd, Ulysses pray'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hail'd the glad omen, and address'd the maid:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O daughter of that god whose arm can wield</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The avenging bolt, and shake the dreadful shield!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O thou! for ever present in my way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who all my motions, all my toils survey!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Safe may we pass beneath the gloomy shade,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Safe by thy succour to our ships convey'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And let some deed this signal night adorn,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To claim the tears of Trojans yet unborn."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then godlike Diomed preferr'd his prayer:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Daughter of Jove, unconquer'd Pallas! hear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great queen of arms, whose favour Tydeus won,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As thou defend'st the sire, defend the son.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When on Æsopus' banks the banded powers</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of Greece he left, and sought the Theban towers,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Peace was his charge; received with peaceful show,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He went a legate, but return'd a foe:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then help'd by thee, and cover'd by thy shield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He fought with numbers, and made numbers yield.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So now be present, O celestial maid!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So still continue to the race thine aid!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A youthful steer shall fall beneath the stroke,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Untamed, unconscious of the galling yoke,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With ample forehead, and with spreading horns,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose taper tops refulgent gold adorns."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The heroes pray'd, and Pallas from the skies</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Accords their vow, succeeds their enterprise.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now, like two lions panting for the prey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With dreadful thoughts they trace the dreary way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through the black horrors of the ensanguined plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through dust, through blood, o'er arms, and hills of slain.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor less bold Hector, and the sons of Troy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On high designs the wakeful hours employ;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The assembled peers their lofty chief enclosed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who thus the counsels of his breast proposed:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What glorious man, for high attempts prepared,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dares greatly venture for a rich reward?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of yonder fleet a bold discovery make,</l>
<pb n="188" /><anchor id="Pg188" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What watch they keep, and what resolves they take?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If now subdued they meditate their flight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, spent with toil, neglect the watch of night?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His be the chariot that shall please him most,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of all the plunder of the vanquish'd host;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His the fair steeds that all the rest excel,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And his the glory to have served so well."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A youth there was among the tribes of Troy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dolon his name, Eumedes' only boy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Five girls beside the reverend herald told.)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rich was the son in brass, and rich in gold;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not bless'd by nature with the charms of face,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But swift of foot, and matchless in the race.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Hector! (he said) my courage bids me meet</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This high achievement, and explore the fleet:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But first exalt thy sceptre to the skies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And swear to grant me the demanded prize;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The immortal coursers, and the glittering car,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That bear Pelides through the ranks of war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Encouraged thus, no idle scout I go,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fulfil thy wish, their whole intention know,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even to the royal tent pursue my way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all their counsels, all their aims betray."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The chief then heaved the golden sceptre high,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Attesting thus the monarch of the sky:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Be witness thou! immortal lord of all!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose thunder shakes the dark aerial hall:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By none but Dolon shall this prize be borne,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And him alone the immortal steeds adorn."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus Hector swore: the gods were call'd in vain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But the rash youth prepares to scour the plain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Across his back the bended bow he flung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A wolf's grey hide around his shoulders hung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A ferret's downy fur his helmet lined,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And in his hand a pointed javelin shined.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then (never to return) he sought the shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And trod the path his feet must tread no more.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Scarce had he pass'd the steeds and Trojan throng,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Still bending forward as he coursed along,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When, on the hollow way, the approaching tread</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ulysses mark'd, and thus to Diomed;</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O friend! I hear some step of hostile feet,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Moving this way, or hastening to the fleet;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some spy, perhaps, to lurk beside the main;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or nightly pillager that strips the slain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet let him pass, and win a little space;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then rush behind him, and prevent his pace.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But if too swift of foot he flies before,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Confine his course along the fleet and shore,</l>
<pb n="189" /><anchor id="Pg189" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Betwixt the camp and him our spears employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And intercept his hoped return to Troy."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With that they stepp'd aside, and stoop'd their head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(As Dolon pass'd,) behind a heap of dead:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Along the path the spy unwary flew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soft, at just distance, both the chiefs pursue.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So distant they, and such the space between,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when two teams of mules divide the green,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(To whom the hind like shares of land allows,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When now new furrows part the approaching ploughs.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now Dolon, listening, heard them as they pass'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hector (he thought) had sent, and check'd his haste,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till scarce at distance of a javelin's throw,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No voice succeeding, he perceived the foe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when two skilful hounds the leveret wind;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or chase through woods obscure the trembling hind;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now lost, now seen, they intercept his way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And from the herd still turn the flying prey:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So fast, and with such fears, the Trojan flew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So close, so constant, the bold Greeks pursue.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now almost on the fleet the dastard falls,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And mingles with the guards that watch the walls;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When brave Tydides stopp'd; a gen'rous thought</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Inspired by Pallas) in his bosom wrought,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lest on the foe some forward Greek advance,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And snatch the glory from his lifted lance.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then thus aloud: "Whoe'er thou art, remain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This javelin else shall fix thee to the plain."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said, and high in air the weapon cast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which wilful err'd, and o'er his shoulder pass'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then fix'd in earth. Against the trembling wood</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wretch stood propp'd, and quiver'd as he stood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A sudden palsy seized his turning head;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His loose teeth chatter'd, and his colour fled;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The panting warriors seize him as he stands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And with unmanly tears his life demands.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O spare my youth, and for the breath I owe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Large gifts of price my father shall bestow:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vast heaps of brass shall in your ships be told,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And steel well-temper'd and refulgent gold."</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">To learn what counsels, what resolves you take:</l>

<p>ARGUMENT</p>

<p>THE THIRD BATTLE, AND THE ACTS OF AGAMEMNON.</p>

<p>Agamemnon, having armed himself, leads the Grecians to battle; Hector
prepares the Trojans to receive them, while Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva
give the signals of war. Agamemnon bears all before him and Hector is
commanded by Jupiter (who sends Iris for that purpose) to decline the
engagement, till the king shall be wounded and retire from the field.
He then makes a great slaughter of the enemy. Ulysses and Diomed put a
stop to him for a time but the latter, being wounded by Paris, is
obliged to desert his companion, who is encompassed by the Trojans,
wounded, and in the utmost danger, till Menelaus and Ajax rescue him.
Hector comes against Ajax, but that hero alone opposes multitudes, and
rallies the Greeks. In the meantime Machaon, in the other wing of the
army, is pierced with an arrow by Paris, and carried from the fight in
Nestor's chariot. Achilles (who overlooked the action from his ship)
sent Patroclus to inquire which of the Greeks was wounded in that
manner; Nestor entertains him in his tent with an account of the
accidents of the day, and a long recital of some former wars which he
remembered, tending to put Patroclus upon persuading Achilles to fight
for his countrymen, or at least to permit him to do it, clad in
Achilles' armour. Patroclus, on his return, meets Eurypylus also
wounded, and assists him in that distress.</p>

<p>This book opens with the eight and-twentieth day of the poem, and the
same day, with its various actions and adventures is extended through
the twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth,
and part of the eighteenth books. The scene lies in the field near the
monument of Ilus.</p>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Writh words like these the fiery chief alarms</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His fainting host, and every bosom warms.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The brindled lion, or the tusky bear:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">With voice and hand provokes their doubting heart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And springs the foremost with his lifted dart:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So godlike Hector prompts his troops to dare;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor prompts alone, but leads himself the war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On the black body of the foe he pours;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As from the cloud's deep bosom, swell'd with showers,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A sudden storm the purple ocean sweeps,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Drives the wild waves, and tosses all the deeps.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Say, Muse! when Jove the Trojan's glory crown'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath his arm what heroes bit the ground?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Assaeus, Dolops, and Autonous died,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Opites next was added to their side;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then brave Hipponous, famed in many a fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Opheltius, Orus, sunk to endless night;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Æsymnus, Agelaus; all chiefs of name;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rest were vulgar deaths unknown to fame.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when a western whirlwind, charged with storms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dispels the gather'd clouds that Notus forms:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gust continued, violent and strong,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rolls sable clouds in heaps on heaps along;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now to the skies the foaming billows rears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now breaks the surge, and wide the bottom bares:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus, raging Hector, with resistless hands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'erturns, confounds, and scatters all their bands.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now the last ruin the whole host appals;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now Greece had trembled in her wooden walls;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But wise Ulysses call'd Tydides forth,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His soul rekindled, and awaked his worth.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"And stand we deedless, O eternal shame!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till Hector's arm involve the ships in flame?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Haste, let us join, and combat side by side."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warrior thus, and thus the friend replied:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"No martial toil I shun, no danger fear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let Hector come; I wait his fury here.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Jove with conquest crowns the Trojan train:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, Jove our foe, all human force is vain."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He sigh'd; but, sighing, raised his vengeful steel,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And from his car the proud Thymbraeus fell:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Molion, the charioteer, pursued his lord,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His death ennobled by Ulysses' sword.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There slain, they left them in eternal night,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then plunged amidst the thickest ranks of fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So two wild boars outstrip the following hounds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then swift revert, and wounds return for wounds.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stern Hector's conquests in the middle plain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stood check'd awhile, and Greece respired again.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sons of Merops shone amidst the war;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Towering they rode in one refulgent car:</l>

<pb n="205" /><anchor id="Pg205" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fate urged them on: the father warn'd in vain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They rush'd to fight, and perish'd on the plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their breasts no more the vital spirit warms;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The stern Tydides strips their shining arms.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hypirochus by great Ulysses dies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And rich Hippodamus becomes his prize.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Jove from Ide with slaughter fills his sight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And level hangs the doubtful scale of fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By Tydeus' lance Agastrophus was slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The far-famed hero of Paeonian strain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wing'd with his fears, on foot he strove to fly,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His steeds too distant, and the foe too nigh:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through broken orders, swifter than the wind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He fled, but flying left his life behind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This Hector sees, as his experienced eyes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Traverse the files, and to the rescue flies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shouts, as he pass'd, the crystal regions rend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And moving armies on his march attend.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Diomed himself was seized with fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus bespoke his brother of the war:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Mark how this way yon bending squadrons yield!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The storm rolls on, and Hector rules the field:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Here stand his utmost force."—The warrior said;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift at the word his ponderous javelin fled;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor miss'd its aim, but where the plumage danced</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Razed the smooth cone, and thence obliquely glanced.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Safe in his helm (the gift of Phoebus' hands)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Without a wound the Trojan hero stands;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But yet so stunn'd, that, staggering on the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His arm and knee his sinking bulk sustain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er his dim sight the misty vapours rise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And a short darkness shades his swimming eyes.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tydides followed to regain his lance;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Hector rose, recover'd from the trance,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Remounts his car, and herds amidst the crowd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greek pursues him, and exults aloud:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Once more thank Phoebus for thy forfeit breath,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or thank that swiftness which outstrips the death.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Well by Apollo are thy prayers repaid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And oft that partial power has lent his aid.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou shall not long the death deserved withstand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If any god assist Tydides' hand.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fly then, inglorious! but thy flight, this day,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">From ancient Ilus' ruin'd monument:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behind the column placed, he bent his bow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And wing'd an arrow at the unwary foe;</l>
<pb n="206" /><anchor id="Pg206" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Just as he stoop'd, Agastrophus's crest</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To seize, and drew the corslet from his breast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bowstring twang'd; nor flew the shaft in vain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But pierced his foot, and nail'd it to the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The laughing Trojan, with a joyful spring.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Leaps from his ambush, and insults the king.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"He bleeds! (he cries) some god has sped my dart!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Would the same god had fix'd it in his heart!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So Troy, relieved from that wide-wasting hand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Should breathe from slaughter and in combat stand:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose sons now tremble at his darted spear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As scatter'd lambs the rushing lion fear."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He dauntless thus: "Thou conqueror of the fair,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou woman-warrior with the curling hair;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vain archer! trusting to the distant dart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unskill'd in arms to act a manly part!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou hast but done what boys or women can;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such hands may wound, but not incense a man.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor boast the scratch thy feeble arrow gave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A coward's weapon never hurts the brave.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not so this dart, which thou may'st one day feel;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fate wings its flight, and death is on the steel:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where this but lights, some noble life expires;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Its touch makes orphans, bathes the cheeks of sires,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Steeps earth in purple, gluts the birds of air,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And leaves such objects as distract the fair."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ulysses hastens with a trembling heart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before him steps, and bending draws the dart:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forth flows the blood; an eager pang succeeds;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tydides mounts, and to the navy speeds.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now on the field Ulysses stands alone,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greeks all fled, the Trojans pouring on;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But stands collected in himself, and whole,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And questions thus his own unconquer'd soul:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What further subterfuge, what hopes remain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What shame, inglorious if I quit the plain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What danger, singly if I stand the ground,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My friends all scatter'd, all the foes around?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet wherefore doubtful? let this truth suffice,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The brave meets danger, and the coward flies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To die or conquer, proves a hero's heart;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, knowing this, I know a soldier's part."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such thoughts revolving in his careful breast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Near, and more near, the shady cohorts press'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These, in the warrior, their own fate enclose;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And round him deep the steely circle grows.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So fares a boar whom all the troop surrounds</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of shouting huntsmen and of clamorous hounds;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He grinds his ivory tusks; he foams with ire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His sanguine eye-balls glare with living fire;</l>
<pb n="207" /><anchor id="Pg207" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By these, by those, on every part is plied;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the red slaughter spreads on every side.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pierced through the shoulder, first Deiopis fell;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next Ennomus and Thoon sank to hell;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Chersidamas, beneath the navel thrust,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Falls prone to earth, and grasps the bloody dust.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Charops, the son of Hippasus, was near;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ulysses reach'd him with the fatal spear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But to his aid his brother Socus flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Socus the brave, the generous, and the wise.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Near as he drew, the warrior thus began:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O great Ulysses! much-enduring man!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not deeper skill'd in every martial sleight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Than worn to toils, and active in the fight!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This day two brothers shall thy conquest grace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And end at once the great Hippasian race,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or thou beneath this lance must press the field."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said, and forceful pierced his spacious shield:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through the strong brass the ringing javelin thrown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Plough'd half his side, and bared it to the bone.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By Pallas' care, the spear, though deep infix'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stopp'd short of life, nor with his entrails mix'd.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wound not mortal wise Ulysses knew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then furious thus (but first some steps withdrew):</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Unhappy man! whose death our hands shall grace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fate calls thee hence and finish'd is thy race.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor longer check my conquests on the foe;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But, pierced by this, to endless darkness go,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And add one spectre to the realms below!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, while Socus, seized with sudden fright,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Trembling gave way, and turn'd his back to flight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Between his shoulders pierced the following dart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And held its passage through the panting heart:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wide in his breast appear'd the grisly wound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He falls; his armour rings against the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then thus Ulysses, gazing on the slain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Famed son of Hippasus! there press the plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There ends thy narrow span assign'd by fate,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heaven owes Ulysses yet a longer date.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ah, wretch! no father shall thy corpse compose;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy dying eyes no tender mother close;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But hungry birds shall tear those balls away,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hovering vultures scream around their prey.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Me Greece shall honour, when I meet my doom,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With solemn funerals and a lasting tomb."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then raging with intolerable smart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He writhes his body, and extracts the dart.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The dart a tide of spouting gore pursued,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gladden'd Troy with sight of hostile blood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now troops on troops the fainting chief invade,</l>
<pb n="208" /><anchor id="Pg208" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forced he recedes, and loudly calls for aid.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thrice to its pitch his lofty voice he rears;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The well-known voice thrice Menelaus hears:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Alarm'd, to Ajax Telamon he cried,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who shares his labours, and defends his side:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O friend! Ulysses' shouts invade my ear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Distressed he seems, and no assistance near;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Strong as he is, yet one opposed to all,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oppress'd by multitudes, the best may fall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Greece robb'd of him must bid her host despair,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And feel a loss not ages can repair."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, where the cry directs, his course he bends;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Ajax, like the god of war, attends,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The prudent chief in sore distress they found,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With bands of furious Trojans compass'd round.<note place="foot"><lg>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when some huntsman, with a flying spear,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He bounds aloft, and scuds from hills to hills,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Broke the dark phalanx, and let in the light:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(By the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The ranks he scatter'd and the troops o'erthrown:)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ajax he shuns, through all the dire debate,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And fears that arm whose force he felt so late.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But partial Jove, espousing Hector's part,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shot heaven-bred horror through the Grecian's heart;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Confused, unnerved in Hector's presence grown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Amazed he stood, with terrors not his own.</l>
<pb n="210" /><anchor id="Pg210" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er his broad back his moony shield he threw,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, glaring round, by tardy steps withdrew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus the grim lion his retreat maintains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beset with watchful dogs, and shouting swains;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Repulsed by numbers from the nightly stalls,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though rage impels him, and though hunger calls,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Long stands the showering darts, and missile fires;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then sourly slow the indignant beast retires:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So turn'd stern Ajax, by whole hosts repell'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While his swoln heart at every step rebell'd.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As the slow beast, with heavy strength endued,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In some wide field by troops of boys pursued,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though round his sides a wooden tempest rain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Crops the tall harvest, and lays waste the plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thick on his hide the hollow blows resound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The patient animal maintains his ground,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Scarce from the field with all their efforts chased,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And stirs but slowly when he stirs at last:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On Ajax thus a weight of Trojans hung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The strokes redoubled on his buckler rung;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Confiding now in bulky strength he stands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now turns, and backward bears the yielding bands;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now stiff recedes, yet hardly seems to fly,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And threats his followers with retorted eye.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fix'd as the bar between two warring powers,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While hissing darts descend in iron showers:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In his broad buckler many a weapon stood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Its surface bristled with a quivering wood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And many a javelin, guiltless on the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Marks the dry dust, and thirsts for blood in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But bold Eurypylus his aid imparts,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And dauntless springs beneath a cloud of darts;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose eager javelin launch'd against the foe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Apisaon felt the fatal blow;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From his torn liver the red current flow'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And his slack knees desert their dying load.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The victor rushing to despoil the dead,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From Paris' bow a vengeful arrow fled;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fix'd in his nervous thigh the weapon stood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fix'd was the point, but broken was the wood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Back to the lines the wounded Greek retired,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet thus retreating, his associates fired:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What god, O Grecians! has your hearts dismay'd?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oh, turn to arms; 'tis Ajax claims your aid.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This hour he stands the mark of hostile rage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And this the last brave battle he shall wage:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Haste, join your forces; from the gloomy grave</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warrior rescue, and your country save."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus urged the chief: a generous troop appears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who spread their bucklers, and advance their spears,</l>
<pb n="211" /><anchor id="Pg211" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To guard their wounded friend: while thus they stand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With pious care, great Ajax joins the band:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each takes new courage at the hero's sight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hero rallies, and renews the fight.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus raged both armies like conflicting fires,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Nestor's chariot far from fight retires:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His coursers steep'd in sweat, and stain'd with gore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greeks' preserver, great Machaon, bore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That hour Achilles, from the topmost height</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of his proud fleet, o'erlook'd the fields of fight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His feasted eyes beheld around the plain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Grecian rout, the slaying, and the slain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His friend Machaon singled from the rest,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A transient pity touch'd his vengeful breast.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Straight to Menoetius' much-loved son he sent:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Graceful as Mars, Patroclus quits his tent;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In evil hour! Then fate decreed his doom,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And fix'd the date of all his woes to come.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Why calls my friend? thy loved injunctions lay;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whate'er thy will, Patroclus shall obey."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O first of friends! (Pelides thus replied)</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall learn the value of the man they lost:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now at my knees the Greeks shall pour their moan,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And proud Atrides tremble on his throne.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Go now to Nestor, and from him be taught</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What wounded warrior late his chariot brought:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For, seen at distance, and but seen behind,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor could I, through yon cloud, discern his face,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The coursers pass'd me with so swift a pace."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hero said. His friend obey'd with haste,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through intermingled ships and tents he pass'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The chiefs descending from their car he found:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warriors standing on the breezy shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To dry their sweat, and wash away the gore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Here paused a moment, while the gentle gale</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Convey'd that freshness the cool seas exhale;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then to consult on farther methods went,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">On each bright handle, bending o'er the brink,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In sculptured gold, two turtles seem to drink:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Temper'd in this, the nymph of form divine</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pours a large portion of the Pramnian wine;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meantime Patroclus, by Achilles sent,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles heeds not, but derides our pain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even till the flames consume our fleet he stays,</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE BATTLE AT THE GRECIAN WALL.</p>

<p>The Greeks having retired into their intrenchments, Hector attempts to
force them; but it proving impossible to pass the ditch, Polydamas
advises to quit their chariots, and manage the attack on foot. The
Trojans follow his counsel; and having divided their army into five
bodies of foot, begin the assault. But upon the signal of an eagle with
a serpent in his talons, which appeared on the left hand of the
Trojans, Polydamas endeavours to withdraw them again. This Hector
opposes, and continues the attack; in which, after many actions,
Sarpedon makes the first breach in the wall. Hector also, casting a
stone of vast size, forces open one of the gates, and enters at the
head of his troops, who victoriously pursue the Grecians even to their
ships.</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While thus the hero's pious cares attend</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The cure and safety of his wounded friend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Trojans and Greeks with clashing shields engage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And mutual deaths are dealt with mutual rage.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor long the trench or lofty walls oppose;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With gods averse the ill-fated works arose;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their powers neglected, and no victim slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The walls were raised, the trenches sunk in vain.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">While sacred Troy the warring hosts engaged;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But when her sons were slain, her city burn'd,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">But this the gods in later times perform;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As yet the bulwark stood, and braved the storm;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The strokes yet echoed of contending powers;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">War thunder'd at the gates, and blood distain'd the towers.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Smote by the arm of Jove with dire dismay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Close by their hollow ships the Grecians lay:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hector's approach in every wind they hear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Hector's fury every moment fear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He, like a whirlwind, toss'd the scattering throng,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mingled the troops, and drove the field along.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So 'midst the dogs and hunters' daring bands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce of his might, a boar or lion stands;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Arm'd foes around a dreadful circle form,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hissing javelins rain an iron storm:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His powers untamed, their bold assault defy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And where he turns the rout disperse or die:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He foams, he glares, he bounds against them all,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And if he falls, his courage makes him fall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With equal rage encompass'd Hector glows;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Exhorts his armies, and the trenches shows.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The panting steeds impatient fury breathe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And snort and tremble at the gulf beneath;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Just at the brink they neigh, and paw the ground,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the turf trembles, and the skies resound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Eager they view'd the prospect dark and deep,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bristled thick with sharpen'd stakes below.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The foot alone this strong defence could force,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And try the pass impervious to the horse.</l>
<pb n="219" /><anchor id="Pg219" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This saw Polydamas; who, wisely brave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Restrain'd great Hector, and this counsel gave:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O thou, bold leader of the Trojan bands!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And you, confederate chiefs from foreign lands!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What entrance here can cumbrous chariots find,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The stakes beneath, the Grecian walls behind?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No pass through those, without a thousand wounds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No space for combat in yon narrow bounds.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Proud of the favours mighty Jove has shown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On certain dangers we too rashly run:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If 'tis will our haughty foes to tame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oh may this instant end the Grecian name!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Here, far from Argos, let their heroes fall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And one great day destroy and bury all!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But should they turn, and here oppress our train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What hopes, what methods of retreat remain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wedged in the trench, by our own troops confused,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In one promiscuous carnage crush'd and bruised,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All Troy must perish, if their arms prevail,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor shall a Trojan live to tell the tale.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hear then, ye warriors! and obey with speed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Back from the trenches let your steeds be led;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then all alighting, wedged in firm array,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Proceed on foot, and Hector lead the way.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So Greece shall stoop before our conquering power,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And this (if Jove consent) her fatal hour."</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">This counsel pleased: the godlike Hector sprung</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift from his seat; his clanging armour rung.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The chief's example follow'd by his train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each quits his car, and issues on the plain,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Compel the coursers to their ranks behind.</l>
<pb n="220" /><anchor id="Pg220" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The forces part in five distinguish'd bands,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The best and bravest in the first conspire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pant for the fight, and threat the fleet with fire:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Hector glorious in the van of these,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Polydamas, and brave Cebriones.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before the next the graceful Paris shines,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bold Alcathous, and Agenor joins.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sons of Priam with the third appear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deiphobus, and Helenas the seer;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In arms with these the mighty Asius stood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who drew from Hyrtacus his noble blood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And whom Arisba's yellow coursers bore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The coursers fed on Selle's winding shore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Antenor's sons the fourth battalion guide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And great Æneas, born on fountful Ide.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Divine Sarpedon the last band obey'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whom Glaucus and Asteropaeus aid.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next him, the bravest, at their army's head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But he more brave than all the hosts he led.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now with compacted shields in close array,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The moving legions speed their headlong way:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Already in their hopes they fire the fleet,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And see the Grecians gasping at their feet.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While every Trojan thus, and every aid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The advice of wise Polydamas obey'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Asius alone, confiding in his car,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His vaunted coursers urged to meet the war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unhappy hero! and advised in vain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Those wheels returning ne'er shall mark the plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No more those coursers with triumphant joy</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Restore their master to the gates of Troy!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Black death attends behind the Grecian wall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And great Idomeneus shall boast thy fall!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce to the left he drives, where from the plain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The flying Grecians strove their ships to gain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift through the wall their horse and chariots pass'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gates half-open'd to receive the last.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thither, exulting in his force, he flies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His following host with clamours rend the skies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To plunge the Grecians headlong in the main,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such their proud hopes; but all their hopes were vain!</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To guard the gates, two mighty chiefs attend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who from the Lapiths' warlike race descend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This Polypoetes, great Perithous' heir,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And that Leonteus, like the god of war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As two tall oaks, before the wall they rise;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their roots in earth, their heads amidst the skies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose spreading arms with leafy honours crown'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forbid the tempest, and protect the ground;</l>
<pb n="221" /><anchor id="Pg221" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High on the hills appears their stately form,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And their deep roots for ever brave the storm.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So graceful these, and so the shock they stand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of raging Asius, and his furious band.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Orestes, Acamas, in front appear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And OEnomaus and Thoon close the rear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain their clamours shake the ambient fields,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain around them beat their hollow shields;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fearless brothers on the Grecians call,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To guard their navies, and defend the wall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even when they saw Troy's sable troops impend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Greece tumultuous from her towers descend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forth from the portals rush'd the intrepid pair,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Opposed their breasts, and stood themselves the war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So two wild boars spring furious from their den,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Roused with the cries of dogs and voice of men;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On every side the crackling trees they tear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And root the shrubs, and lay the forest bare;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They gnash their tusks, with fire their eye-balls roll,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till some wide wound lets out their mighty soul.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Around their heads the whistling javelins sung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With sounding strokes their brazen targets rung;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce was the fight, while yet the Grecian powers</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Maintain'd the walls, and mann'd the lofty towers:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To save their fleet their last efforts they try,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And stones and darts in mingled tempests fly.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when sharp Boreas blows abroad, and brings</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The dreary winter on his frozen wings;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath the low-hung clouds the sheets of snow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Descend, and whiten all the fields below:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So fast the darts on either army pour,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So down the rampires rolls the rocky shower:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heavy, and thick, resound the batter'd shields,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the deaf echo rattles round the fields.</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With shame repulsed, with grief and fury driven,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The frantic Asius thus accuses Heaven:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"In powers immortal who shall now believe?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Can those too flatter, and can Jove deceive?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What man could doubt but Troy's victorious power</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Should humble Greece, and this her fatal hour?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But like when wasps from hollow crannies drive,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To guard the entrance of their common hive,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Darkening the rock, while with unwearied wings</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They strike the assailants, and infix their stings;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A race determined, that to death contend:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Greece unconquer'd kept alive the war,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all her guardian gods, in deep dismay,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even yet the dauntless Lapithae maintain</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pierced through his helmet's brazen visor, fell;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The weapon drank the mingled brains and gore!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warrior sinks, tremendous now no more!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next Ormenus and Pylon yield their breath:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor less Leonteus strews the field with death;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">First through the belt Hippomachus he gored,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then sudden waved his unresisted sword:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Antiphates, as through the ranks he broke,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The falchion struck, and fate pursued the stroke:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Iamenus, Orestes, Menon, bled;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And round him rose a monument of dead.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meantime, the bravest of the Trojan crew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bold Hector and Polydamas, pursue;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce with impatience on the works to fall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And wrap in rolling flames the fleet and wall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These on the farther bank now stood and gazed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By Heaven alarm'd, by prodigies amazed:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A signal omen stopp'd the passing host,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their martial fury in their wonder lost.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove's bird on sounding pinions beat the skies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A bleeding serpent of enormous size,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His talons truss'd; alive, and curling round,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He stung the bird, whose throat received the wound:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mad with the smart, he drops the fatal prey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In airy circles wings his painful way,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then first Polydamas the silence broke,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"How oft, my brother, thy reproach I bear,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">To speak his thoughts is every freeman's right,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all I move, deferring to thy sway,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But tends to raise that power which I obey.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then hear my words, nor may my words be vain!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Seek not this day the Grecian ships to gain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For sure, to warn us, Jove his omen sent,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus my mind explains its clear event:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The victor eagle, whose sinister flight</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Retards our host, and fills our hearts with fright,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dismiss'd his conquest in the middle skies,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">While I the dictates of high heaven obey.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Without a sign his sword the brave man draws,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">But why should'st thou suspect the war's success?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">None fears it more, as none promotes it less:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on the Lycian's helmet thundering down,</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE FOURTH BATTLE CONTINUED, IN WHICH NEPTUNE ASSISTS THE GREEKS:
THE ACTS OF IDOMENEUS.</p>

<p>Neptune, concerned for the loss of the Grecians, upon seeing the
fortification forced by Hector, (who had entered the gate near the
station of the Ajaces,) assumes the shape of Calchas, and inspires
those heroes to oppose him: then, in the form of one of the generals,
encourages the other Greeks who had retired to their vessels. The
Ajaces form their troops in a close phalanx, and put a stop to Hector
and the Trojans. Several deeds of valour are performed; Meriones,
losing his spear in the encounter, repairs to seek another at the tent
of Idomeneus: this occasions a conversation between those two warriors,
who return together to the battle. Idomeneus signalizes his courage
above the rest; he kills Othryoneus, Asius, and Alcathous: Deiphobus
and Æneas march against him, and at length Idomeneus retires. Menelaus
wounds Helenus, and kills Pisander. The Trojans are repulsed on the
left wing; Hector still keeps his ground against the Ajaces, till,
being galled by the Locrian slingers and archers, Polydamas advises to
call a council of war: Hector approves of his advice, but goes first to
rally the Trojans; upbraids Paris, rejoins Polydamas, meets Ajax again,
and renews the attack.</p>

<p>The eight-and-twentieth day still continues. The scene is between the
Grecian wall and the sea-shore.</p>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">When now the Thunderer on the sea-beat coast</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Had fix'd great Hector and his conquering host,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He left them to the fates, in bloody fray</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To toil and struggle through the well-fought day.</l>

de Exp. Alex. iv. p. 239, also speaks of the independence of these
people, which he regards as the result of their poverty and
uprightness. Some authors have regarded the phrase "Hippomolgian,"
<hi rend="font-style: italic">i.e.</hi> "milking their mares," as an epithet applicable to numerous
tribes, since the oldest of the Samatian nomads made their mares' milk
one of their chief articles of diet. The epithet abion or abion, in
this passage, has occasioned much discussion. It may mean, according as
we read it, either "long-lived," or "bowless," the latter epithet
indicating that they did not depend upon archery for subsistence.</p></note></l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose waving woods o'erhung the deeps below,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He sat; and round him cast his azure eyes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where Ida's misty tops confusedly rise;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And felt the footsteps of the immortal god.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From realm to realm three ample strides he took,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far in the bay his shining palace stands,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even there thy courage would not lag behind:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In that sharp service, singled from the rest,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fear of each, or valour, stands confess'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No force, no firmness, the pale coward shows;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He shifts his place: his colour comes and goes:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A dropping sweat creeps cold on every part;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Against his bosom beats his quivering heart;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Terror and death in his wild eye-balls stare;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With chattering teeth he stands, and stiffening hair,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And looks a bloodless image of despair!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not so the brave—still dauntless, still the same,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unchanged his colour, and unmoved his frame:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Composed his thought, determined is his eye,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And fix'd his soul, to conquer or to die:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If aught disturb the tenour of his breast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis but the wish to strike before the rest.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"In such assays thy blameless worth is known,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And every art of dangerous war thy own.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By chance of fight whatever wounds you bore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Those wounds were glorious all, and all before;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such as may teach, 'twas still thy brave delight</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">T'oppose thy bosom where thy foremost fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But why, like infants, cold to honour's charms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stand we to talk, when glory calls to arms?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Go—from my conquer'd spears the choicest take,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And to their owners send them nobly back."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift at the word bold Merion snatch'd a spear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, breathing slaughter, follow'd to the war.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">So Mars armipotent invades the plain,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The pride of haughty warriors to confound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And lay the strength of tyrants on the ground:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From Thrace they fly, call'd to the dire alarms</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of warring Phlegyans, and Ephyrian arms;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Invoked by both, relentless they dispose,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To these glad conquest, murderous rout to those.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So march'd the leaders of the Cretan train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And their bright arms shot horror o'er the plain.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then first spake Merion: "Shall we join the right,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or combat in the centre of the fight?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or to the left our wonted succour lend?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hazard and fame all parts alike attend."</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each godlike Ajax makes that post his care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gallant Teucer deals destruction there,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Skill'd or with shafts to gall the distant field,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or bear close battle on the sounding shield.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These can the rage of haughty Hector tame:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Safe in their arms, the navy fears no flame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till Jove himself descends, his bolts to shed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hurl the blazing ruin at our head.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great must he be, of more than human birth,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor feed like mortals on the fruits of earth.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Him neither rocks can crush, nor steel can wound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whom Ajax fells not on the ensanguined ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In standing fight he mates Achilles' force,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Excell'd alone in swiftness in the course.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then to the left our ready arms apply,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And live with glory, or with glory die."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said: and Merion to th' appointed place,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce as the god of battles, urged his pace.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon as the foe the shining chiefs beheld</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rush like a fiery torrent o'er the field,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their force embodied in a tide they pour;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rising combat sounds along the shore.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">All dreadful glared the iron face of war,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bristled with upright spears, that flash'd afar;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dire was the gleam of breastplates, helms, and shields,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Gods of one source, of one ethereal race,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Alike divine, and heaven their native place;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Jove the greater; first-born of the skies,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">For this, of Jove's superior might afraid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Neptune in human form conceal'd his aid.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These powers enfold the Greek and Trojan train</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In war and discord's adamantine chain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Indissolubly strong: the fatal tie</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The king consented, by his vaunts abused;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The king consented, but the fates refused.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Proud of himself, and of the imagined bride,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The riven armour sends a jarring sound;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forthwith Æneas rises to his thought:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For him in Troy's remotest lines he sought,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where he, incensed at partial Priam, stands,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">To him, ambitious of so great an aid,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Æneas heard, and for a space resign'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To tender pity all his manly mind;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then rising in his rage, he burns to fight:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greek awaits him with collected might.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As the fell boar, on some rough mountain's head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Arm'd with wild terrors, and to slaughter bred,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">His foaming tusks both dogs and men engage;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But most his hunters rouse his mighty rage:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So stood Idomeneus, his javelin shook,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And met the Trojan with a lowering look.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Antilochus, Deipyrus, were near,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The youthful offspring of the god of war,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Merion, and Aphareus, in field renown'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To these the warrior sent his voice around.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Fellows in arms! your timely aid unite;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo, great Æneas rushes to the fight:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sprung from a god, and more than mortal bold;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He fresh in youth, and I in arms grown old.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Else should this hand, this hour decide the strife,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, and all, as with one soul, obey'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their lifted bucklers cast a dreadful shade</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Around the chief. Æneas too demands</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Th' assisting forces of his native bands;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Paris, Deiphobus, Agenor, join;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Co-aids and captains of the Trojan line;)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In order follow all th' embodied train,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before his fleecy care, erect and bold,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">With joy the swain surveys them, as he leads</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To the cool fountains, through the well-known meads:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So joys Æneas, as his native band</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Round dread Alcathous now the battle rose;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And o'er their heads unheeded javelins sing.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Above the rest, two towering chiefs appear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There great Idomeneus, Æneas here.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Trojan weapon whizz'd along in air;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Cretan saw, and shunn'd the brazen spear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sent from an arm so strong, the missive wood</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stuck deep in earth, and quiver'd where it stood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But OEnomas received the Cretan's stroke;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The forceful spear his hollow corslet broke,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">It ripp'd his belly with a ghastly wound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And roll'd the smoking entrails on the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stretch'd on the plain, he sobs away his breath,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, furious, grasps the bloody dust in death.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The victor from his breast the weapon tears;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His spoils he could not, for the shower of spears.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though now unfit an active war to wage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heavy with cumbrous arms, stiff with cold age,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His listless limbs unable for the course,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In standing fight he yet maintains his force;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till faint with labour, and by foes repell'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His tired slow steps he drags from off the field.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deiphobus beheld him as he pass'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, fired with hate, a parting javelin cast:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The javelin err'd, but held its course along,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And pierced Ascalaphus, the brave and young:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The son of Mars fell gasping on the ground,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gnash'd the dust, all bloody with his wound.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor knew the furious father of his fall;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High-throned amidst the great Olympian hall,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now, where in dust the breathless hero lay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For slain Ascalaphus commenced the fray,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deiphobus to seize his helmet flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And from his temples rends the glittering prize;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Valiant as Mars, Meriones drew near,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And on his loaded arm discharged his spear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He drops the weight, disabled with the pain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hollow helmet rings against the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift as a vulture leaping on his prey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From his torn arm the Grecian rent away</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The reeking javelin, and rejoin'd his friends.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His wounded brother good Polites tends;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Around his waist his pious arms he threw,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And from the rage of battle gently drew:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Him his swift coursers, on his splendid car,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rapt from the lessening thunder of the war;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Troy they drove him, groaning from the shore,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">His shield reversed o'er the fallen warrior lies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And everlasting slumber seals his eyes.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Antilochus, as Thoon turn'd him round,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Transpierced his back with a dishonest wound:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hollow vein, that to the neck extends</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Along the chine, his eager javelin rends:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Supine he falls, and to his social train</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Spreads his imploring arms, but spreads in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Th' exulting victor, leaping where he lay,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">His shield emboss'd the ringing storm sustains,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">In arms intrepid, with the first he fought,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The son of Asius, Adamas, drew near,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And struck his target with the brazen spear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce in his front: but Neptune wards the blow,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">In the broad buckler half the weapon stood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Splinter'd on earth flew half the broken wood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Disarm'd, he mingled in the Trojan crew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Merion's spear o'ertook him as he flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deep in the belly's rim an entrance found,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where sharp the pang, and mortal is the wound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bending he fell, and doubled to the ground,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lay panting. Thus an ox in fetters tied,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While death's strong pangs distend his labouring side,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far-echoing clamours bound from side to side;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They ceased; and thus the chief of Troy replied:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"From whence this menace, this insulting strain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Enormous boaster! doom'd to vaunt in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So may the gods on Hector life bestow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Not that short life which mortals lead below,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lance of Hector, thou shalt meet thy fate:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That giant-corse, extended on the shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall largely feast the fowls with fat and gore."</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said; and like a lion stalk'd along:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With shouts incessant earth and ocean rung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sent from his following host: the Grecian train</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With answering thunders fill'd the echoing plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A shout that tore heaven's concave, and, above,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shook the fix'd splendours of the throne of Jove.</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.<note place="foot"><p>This book forms a most agreeable interruption to
The continuous round of battles, which occupy the latter part of the
Iliad. It is as well to observe, that the sameness of these scenes
renders many notes unnecessary.</p></note></p>

<p>JUNO DECEIVES JUPITER BY THE GIRDLE OF VENUS.</p>

<p>Nestor, sitting at the table with Machaon, is alarmed with the
increasing clamour of war, and hastens to Agamemnon; on his way he
meets that prince with Diomed and Ulysses, whom he informs of the
extremity of the danger. Agamemnon proposes to make their escape by
night, which Ulysses withstands; to which Diomed adds his advice, that,
wounded as they were, they should go forth and encourage the army with
their presence, which advice is pursued. Juno, seeing the partiality of
Jupiter to the Trojans, forms a design to over-reach him: she sets off
her charms with the utmost care, and (the more surely to enchant him)
obtains the magic girdle of Venus. She then applies herself to the god
of sleep, and, with some difficulty, persuades him to seal the eyes of
Jupiter: this done, she goes to mount Ida, where the god, at first
sight, is ravished with her beauty, sinks in her embraces, and is laid
asleep. Neptune takes advantage of his slumber, and succours the
Greeks: Hector is struck to the ground with a prodigious stone by Ajax,
and carried off from the battle: several actions succeed, till the
Trojans, much distressed, are obliged to give way: the lesser Ajax
signalizes himself in a particular manner.</p>


<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But not the genial feast, nor flowing bowl,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Could charm the cares of Nestor's watchful soul;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His startled ears the increasing cries attend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then thus, impatient, to his wounded friend:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What new alarm, divine Machaon, say,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What mix'd events attend this mighty day?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hark! how the shouts divide, and how they meet,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now come full, and thicken to the fleet!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Here with the cordial draught dispel thy care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let Hecamede the strengthening bath prepare,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Refresh thy wound, and cleanse the clotted gore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While I the adventures of the day explore."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said: and, seizing Thrasymedes' shield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(His valiant offspring,) hasten'd to the field;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(That day the son his father's buckler bore;)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then snatch'd a lance, and issued from the door.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon as the prospect open'd to his view,</l>
<pb n="254" /><anchor id="Pg254" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His wounded eyes the scene of sorrow knew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dire disarray! the tumult of the fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wall in ruins, and the Greeks in flight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when old ocean's silent surface sleeps,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The waves just heaving on the purple deeps:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While yet the expected tempest hangs on high,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Weighs down the cloud, and blackens in the sky,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The mass of waters will no wind obey;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove sends one gust, and bids them roll away.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While wavering counsels thus his mind engage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fluctuates in doubtful thought the Pylian sage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To join the host, or to the general haste;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Debating long, he fixes on the last:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet, as he moves, the sight his bosom warms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The field rings dreadful with the clang of arms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gleaming falchions flash, the javelins fly;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Blows echo blows, and all or kill or die.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Him, in his march, the wounded princes meet,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By tardy steps ascending from the fleet:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The king of men, Ulysses the divine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And who to Tydeus owes his noble line.<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Who to Tydeus owes, i.e.</hi> Diomed.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Their ships at distance from the battle stand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In lines advanced along the shelving strand:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose bay, the fleet unable to contain</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Supported on the spears, they took their way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unfit to fight, but anxious for the day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nestor's approach alarm'd each Grecian breast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whom thus the general of the host address'd:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O grace and glory of the Achaian name;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What drives thee, Nestor, from the field of fame?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall then proud Hector see his boast fulfill'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Our fleets in ashes, and our heroes kill'd?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such was his threat, ah! now too soon made good,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On many a Grecian bosom writ in blood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Is every heart inflamed with equal rage</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Against your king, nor will one chief engage?</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">In every Greek a new Achilles rise?"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Gerenian Nestor then: "So fate has will'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all-confirming time has fate fulfill'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not he that thunders from the aerial bower,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not Jove himself, upon the past has power.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The wall, our late inviolable bound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And best defence, lies smoking on the ground:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">On speedy measures then employ your thought</l>

incensed at the artifice of Juno, who appeases him by her submissions;
she is then sent to Iris and Apollo. Juno, repairing to the assembly of
the gods, attempts, with extraordinary address, to incense them against
Jupiter; in particular she touches Mars with a violent resentment; he
is ready to take arms, but is prevented by Minerva. Iris and Apollo
obey the orders of Jupiter; Iris commands Neptune to leave the battle,
to which, after much reluctance and passion, he consents. Apollo
reinspires Hector with vigour, brings him back to the battle, marches
before him with his aegis, and turns the fortune of the fight. He
breaks down great part of the Grecian wall: the Trojans rush in, and
attempt to fire the first line of the fleet, but are, as yet, repelled
by the greater Ajax with a prodigious slaughter.</p>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus to bold Hector spoke the son of Jove,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And breathed immortal ardour from above.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when the pamper'd steed, with reins unbound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Breaks from his stall, and pours along the ground;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With ample strokes he rushes to the flood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To bathe his sides, and cool his fiery blood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His head, now freed, he tosses to the skies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His mane dishevell'd o'er his shoulders flies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He snuffs the females in the well-known plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And springs, exulting, to his fields again:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Urged by the voice divine, thus Hector flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full of the god; and all his hosts pursue.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when the force of men and dogs combined</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Invade the mountain goat, or branching hind;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far from the hunter's rage secure they lie</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Close in the rock, (not fated yet to die)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When lo! a lion shoots across the way!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They fly: at once the chasers and the prey.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So Greece, that late in conquering troops pursued,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And mark'd their progress through the ranks in blood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon as they see the furious chief appear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forget to vanquish, and consent to fear.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo! Hector rises from the Stygian shades!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">We saw him, late, by thundering Ajax kill'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What god restores him to the frighted field;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And not content that half of Greece lie slain,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He comes not, Jove! without thy powerful will;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo! still he lives, pursues, and conquers still!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet hear my counsel, and his worst withstand:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greeks' main body to the fleet command;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But let the few whom brisker spirits warm,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stand the first onset, and provoke the storm.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus point your arms; and when such foes appear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce as he is, let Hector learn to fear."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warrior spoke; the listening Greeks obey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thickening their ranks, and form a deep array.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">To flank the navy, and the shores defend.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on the front the pressing Trojans bear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Hector first came towering to the war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Phoebus himself the rushing battle led;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A veil of clouds involved his radiant head:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High held before him, Jove's enormous shield</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Portentous shone, and shaded all the field;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vulcan to Jove the immortal gift consign'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To scatter hosts and terrify mankind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greeks expect the shock, the clamours rise</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From different parts, and mingle in the skies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dire was the hiss of darts, by heroes flung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And arrows leaping from the bow-string sung;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These drink the life of generous warriors slain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Those guiltless fall, and thirst for blood in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As long as Phoebus bore unmoved the shield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sat doubtful conquest hovering o'er the field;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But when aloft he shakes it in the skies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shouts in their ears, and lightens in their eyes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deep horror seizes every Grecian breast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their force is humbled, and their fear confess'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So flies a herd of oxen, scatter'd wide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No swain to guard them, and no day to guide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When two fell lions from the mountain come,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And spread the carnage through the shady gloom.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Impending Phoebus pours around them fear,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">On rush'd bold Hector, gloomy as the night;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The son of Clytius in his daring hand,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">It stretch'd in dust unhappy Lycophron:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Down dropp'd the bow: the shaft with brazen head</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis now no time for wisdom or debates;</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His generous sense he not in vain imparts;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">It sunk, and rooted in the Grecian hearts:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They join, they throng, they thicken at his call,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And flank the navy with a brazen wall;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shields touching shields, in order blaze above,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And stop the Trojans, though impell'd by Jove.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fiery Spartan first, with loud applause.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Warms the bold son of Nestor in his cause.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Is there (he said) in arms a youth like you,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So strong to fight, so active to pursue?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Why stand you distant, nor attempt a deed?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lift the bold lance, and make some Trojan bleed."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said; and backward to the lines retired;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forth rush'd the youth with martial fury fired,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beyond the foremost ranks; his lance he threw,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And round the black battalions cast his view.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The troops of Troy recede with sudden fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While the swift javelin hiss'd along in air.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Advancing Melanippus met the dart</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With his bold breast, and felt it in his heart:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thundering he falls; his falling arms resound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And his broad buckler rings against the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The victor leaps upon his prostrate prize:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus on a roe the well-breath'd beagle flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And rends his side, fresh-bleeding with the dart</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The distant hunter sent into his heart.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Observing Hector to the rescue flew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bold as he was, Antilochus withdrew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So when a savage, ranging o'er the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Has torn the shepherd's dog, or shepherd's swain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While conscious of the deed, he glares around,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hears the gathering multitude resound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Timely he flies the yet-untasted food,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gains the friendly shelter of the wood:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So fears the youth; all Troy with shouts pursue,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While stones and darts in mingled tempest flew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But enter'd in the Grecian ranks, he turns</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His manly breast, and with new fury burns.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now on the fleet the tides of Trojans drove,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">On Ida's top he waits with longing eyes,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, nor till then, the scale of war shall turn,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Trojans fly, and conquer'd Ilion burn.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These fates revolved in his almighty mind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He raises Hector to the work design'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bids him with more than mortal fury glow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And drives him, like a lightning, on the foe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So Mars, when human crimes for vengeance call,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shakes his huge javelin, and whole armies fall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not with more rage a conflagration rolls,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wraps the vast mountains, and involves the poles.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He foams with wrath; beneath his gloomy brow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like fiery meteors his red eye-balls glow:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The radiant helmet on his temple burns,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Waves when he nods, and lightens as he turns:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For Jove his splendour round the chief had thrown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And cast the blaze of both the hosts on one.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unhappy glories! for his fate was near,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Due to stern Pallas, and Pelides' spear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet Jove deferr'd the death he was to pay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gave what fate allow'd, the honours of a day!</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now all on fire for fame, his breast, his eyes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Burn at each foe, and single every prize;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still at the closest ranks, the thickest fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He points his ardour, and exerts his might.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Grecian phalanx, moveless as a tower,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On all sides batter'd, yet resists his power:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So some tall rock o'erhangs the hoary main,<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">So some tall rock.</hi></p>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">But doom'd to Hector's stronger force to yield!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Against the margin of his ample shield</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He struck his hasty foot: his heels up-sprung;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Supine he fell; his brazen helmet rung.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On the fallen chief the invading Trojan press'd,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">His circling friends, who strove to guard too late</l>

<p>ARGUMENT</p>

<p>THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS</p>

<p>Patroclus (in pursuance of the request of Nestor in the eleventh book)
entreats Achilles to suffer him to go to the assistance of the Greeks
with Achilles' troops and armour. He agrees to it, but at the same time
charges him to content himself with rescuing the fleet, without further
pursuit of the enemy. The armour, horses, soldiers, and officers are
described. Achilles offers a libation for the success of his friend,
after which Patroclus leads the Myrmidons to battle. The Trojans, at
the sight of Patroclus in Achilles' armour, taking him for that hero,
are cast into the uttermost consternation; he beats them off from
the vessels, Hector himself flies, Sarpedon is killed, though Jupiter
was averse to his fate. Several other particulars of the battle are
described; in the heat of which, Patroclus, neglecting the orders of
Achilles, pursues the foe to the walls of Troy, where Apollo repulses
and disarms him, Euphorbus wounds him, and Hector kills him, which
concludes the book.</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So warr'd both armies on the ensanguined shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While the black vessels smoked with human gore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meantime Patroclus to Achilles flies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The streaming tears fall copious from his eyes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not faster, trickling to the plains below,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From the tall rock the sable waters flow.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Divine Pelides, with compassion moved.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spoke, indulgent, to his best beloved:<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">His best beloved.</hi> The following elegant remarks of
Thirlwall (Greece, vol. i, p. 176 seq.) well illustrate the character
of the friendship subsisting between these two heroes—</p>

<p>"One of the noblest and most amiable sides of the Greek character, is
the readiness with which it lent itself to construct intimate and
durable friendships, and this is a feature no less prominent in the
earliest than in later times. It was indeed connected with the
comparatively low estimation in which female society was held; but the
devotedness and constancy with which these attachments were maintained,
was not the less admirable and engaging. The heroic companions whom we
find celebrated partly by Homer and partly in traditions which, if not
of equal antiquity, were grounded on the same feeling, seem to have but
one heart and soul, with scarcely a wish or object apart, and only to
live as they are always ready to die for one another. It is true that
the relation between them is not always one of perfect equality; but
this is a circumstance which, while it often adds a peculiar charm
to the poetical description, detracts little from the dignity of the
idea which it presents. Such were the friendships of Hercules and
Iolaus, of Theseus and Pirithous, of Orestes and Pylades; and though
These may owe the greater part of their fame to the later epic or even
dramatic poetry, the moral groundwork undoubtedly subsisted in the
period to which the traditions are referred. The argument of the Iliad
mainly turns on the affection of Achilles for Patroclus, whose love for
the greater hero is only tempered by reverence for his higher birth and
his unequalled prowess. But the mutual regard which united Idomeneus
and Meriones, Diomedes and Sthenelus, though, as the persons themselves
are less important, it is kept more in the back-ground, is manifestly
viewed by the poet in the same light. The idea of a Greek hero seems
not to have been thought complete, without such a brother in arms by
his side."—Thirlwall, Greece, vol. i. p. 176, seq.</p></note></l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Patroclus, say, what grief thy bosom bears,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">No girl, no infant whom the mother keeps</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From her loved breast, with fonder passion weeps;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not more the mother's soul, that infant warms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Clung to her knees, and reaching at her arms,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy melting sorrows thus pursue thy friend?</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Griev'st thou for me, or for, my martial band?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or come sad tidings from our native land?</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And pay the forfeit of their haughty lord?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whate'er the cause, reveal thy secret care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And speak those sorrows which a friend would share."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A sigh that instant from his bosom broke,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Another follow'd, and Patroclus spoke:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Let Greece at length with pity touch thy breast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thyself a Greek; and, once, of Greeks the best!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo! every chief that might her fate prevent,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lies pierced with wounds, and bleeding in his tent:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Eurypylus, Tydides, Atreus' son,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And wise Ulysses, at the navy groan,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">More for their country's wounds than for their own.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their pain soft arts of pharmacy can ease,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy breast alone no lenitives appease.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">May never rage like thine my soul enslave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O great in vain! unprofitably brave!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy country slighted in her last distress,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What friend, what man, from thee shall hope redress?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No—men unborn, and ages yet behind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall curse that fierce, that unforgiving mind.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O man unpitying! if of man thy race;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But sure thou spring'st not from a soft embrace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor ever amorous hero caused thy birth,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor ever tender goddess brought thee forth:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some rugged rock's hard entrails gave thee form,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And raging seas produced thee in a storm,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A soul well suiting that tempestuous kind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So rough thy manners, so untamed thy mind.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor aught a mother's caution can suggest;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The tyrant's pride lies rooted in my breast.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Due to the votes of all the Grecian train.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From me he forced her; me, the bold and brave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Disgraced, dishonour'd, like the meanest slave.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But bear we this—the wrongs I grieve are past;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis time our fury should relent at last:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I fix'd its date; the day I wish'd appears:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How Hector to my ships his battle bears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The flames my eyes, the shouts invade my ears.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Go then, Patroclus! court fair honour's charms</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In Troy's famed fields, and in Achilles' arms:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lead forth my martial Myrmidons to fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Go save the fleets, and conquer in my right.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">See the thin relics of their baffled band</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At the last edge of yon deserted land!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behold all Ilion on their ships descends;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How the cloud blackens, how the storm impends!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">It was not thus, when, at my sight amazed,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">No longer flames the lance of Tydeus' son;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No more your general calls his heroes on:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now save the ships, the rising fires restrain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And give the Greeks to visit Greece again.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But heed my words, and mark a friend's command,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who trusts his fame and honours in thy hand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And from thy deeds expects the Achaian host</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall render back the beauteous maid he lost:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rage uncontroll'd through all the hostile crew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But touch not Hector, Hector is my due.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though Jove in thunder should command the war,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Be just, consult my glory, and forbear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fleet once saved, desist from further chase,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor lead to Ilion's walls the Grecian race;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some adverse god thy rashness may destroy;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some god, like Phoebus, ever kind to Troy.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let Greece, redeem'd from this destructive strait,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Do her own work; and leave the rest to fate.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O! would to all the immortal powers above,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Apollo, Pallas, and almighty Jove!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That not one Trojan might be left alive,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And not a Greek of all the race survive:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Might only we the vast destruction shun,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And only we destroy the accursed town!"</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such conference held the chiefs; while on the strand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Jove with conquest crown'd the Trojan band.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ajax no more the sounding storm sustain'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So thick the darts an iron tempest rain'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On his tired arm the weighty buckler hung;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His hollow helm with falling javelins rung;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His breath, in quick short pantings, comes and goes;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And painful sweat from all his members flows.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Spent and o'erpower'd, he barely breathes at most;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet scarce an army stirs him from his post;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dangers on dangers all around him glow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And toil to toil, and woe succeeds to woe.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Say, Muses, throned above the starry frame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How first the navy blazed with Trojan flame?</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">His pointless spear the warrior shakes in vain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The brazen head falls sounding on the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Ajax saw, and own'd the hand divine;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Confessing Jove, and trembling at the sign,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Warn'd he retreats. Then swift from all sides pour</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hissing brands; thick streams the fiery shower;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er the high stern the curling volumes rise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sheets of rolling smoke involve the skies.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">This tinged with sulphur, sacred first to flame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He purged; and wash'd it in the running stream.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">His eyes on heaven, his feet upon the place</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of sacrifice, the purple draught he pour'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forth in the midst; and thus the god implored:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And catch the fates, low-whispered in the breeze;)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hear, as of old! Thou gav'st, at Thetis' prayer,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Glory to me, and to the Greeks despair.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo, to the dangers of the fighting field</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The best, the dearest of my friends, I yield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though still determined, to my ships confined;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Patroclus gone, I stay but half behind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oh! be his guard thy providential care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Confirm his heart, and string his arm to war:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Press'd by his single force let Hector see</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His fame in arms not owing all to me.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But when the fleets are saved from foes and fire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let him with conquest and renown retire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Preserve his arms, preserve his social train,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Jove consents to half the chief's request,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus from the tents the fervent legion swarms,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who thus inflames them with heroic fires:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">From shore to shore the doubling shouts resound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hollow ships return a deeper sound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The war stood still, and all around them gazed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When great Achilles' shining armour blazed:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">At once they see, they tremble, and they fly.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then first thy spear, divine Patroclus! flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where the war raged, and where the tumult grew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Close to the stern of that famed ship which bore</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unbless'd Protesilaus to Ilion's shore,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The groaning warrior pants upon the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His troops, that see their country's glory slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fly diverse, scatter'd o'er the distant plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Patroclus' arm forbids the spreading fires,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And from the half-burn'd ship proud Troy retires;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Clear'd from the smoke the joyful navy lies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In heaps on heaps the foe tumultuous flies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Triumphant Greece her rescued decks ascends,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And loud acclaim the starry region rends.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So when thick clouds enwrap the mountain's head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er heaven's expanse like one black ceiling spread;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sudden the Thunderer, with a flashing ray,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bursts through the darkness, and lets down the day:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hills shine out, the rocks in prospect rise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And streams, and vales, and forests, strike the eyes;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The smiling scene wide opens to the sight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all the unmeasured ether flames with light.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Troy repulsed, and scatter'd o'er the plains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forced from the navy, yet the fight maintains.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now every Greek some hostile hero slew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But still the foremost, bold Patroclus flew:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As Areilycus had turn'd him round,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The brazen-pointed spear, with vigour thrown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The thigh transfix'd, and broke the brittle bone:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Headlong he fell. Next, Thoas was thy chance;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy breast, unarm'd, received the Spartan lance.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Phylides' dart (as Amphidus drew nigh)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His blow prevented, and transpierced his thigh,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tore all the brawn, and rent the nerves away;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In darkness, and in death, the warrior lay.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sword broke short; but his, Peneleus sped</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on the juncture of the neck and head:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"The hour draws on; the destinies ordain,<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">The destinies ordain.</hi>—"In the mythology, also, of the
Iliad, purely Pagan as it is, we discover one important truth
unconsciously involved, which was almost entirely lost from view
amidst the nearly equal scepticism and credulity of subsequent ages.
Zeus or Jupiter is popularly to be taken as omnipotent. No distinct
empire is assigned to fate or fortune; the will of the father of gods
and men is absolute and uncontrollable. This seems to be the true
character of the Homeric deity, and it is very necessary that the
student of Greek literature should bear it constantly in mind. A strong
instance in the Iliad itself to illustrate this position, is the
passage where Jupiter laments to Juno the approaching death of
Sarpedon. 'Alas me!' says he 'since it is fated (moira) that Sarpedon,
dearest to me of men, should be slain by Patroclus, the son of
Menoetius! Indeed, my heart is divided within me while I ruminate it in
my mind, whether having snatched him up from out of the lamentable
battle, I should not at once place him alive in the fertile land of his
own Lycia, or whether I should now destroy him by the hands of the son
of Menoetius!' To which Juno answers—'Dost thou mean to rescue from
death a mortal man, long since destined by fate (palai pepromenon)?
You may do it—but we, the rest of the gods, do not sanction it.' Here
it is clear from both speakers, that although Sarpedon is said to be
fated to die, Jupiter might still, if he pleased, save him, and place
him entirely out of the reach of any such event, and further, in the
alternative, that Jupiter himself would destroy him by the hands of
another."—Coleridge, p. 156. seq.</p></note></l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now met in arms, the combatants appear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each heaved the shield, and poised the lifted spear;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Roll'd in the bloody dust, and paw'd the slippery ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His sudden fall the entangled harness broke;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each axle crackled, and the chariot shook:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When bold Automedon, to disengage</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The starting coursers, and restrain their rage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Divides the traces with his sword, and freed</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The encumbered chariot from the dying steed:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rest move on, obedient to the rein:</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The towering chiefs to fiercer fight advance:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And first Sarpedon whirl'd his weighty lance,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which o'er the warrior's shoulder took its course,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And spent in empty air its dying force.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not so Patroclus' never-erring dart;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Aim'd at his breast it pierced a mortal part,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where the strong fibres bind the solid heart.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then as the mountain oak, or poplar tall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or pine (fit mast for some great admiral)</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The prostrate prince, and on his bosom trod;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then drew the weapon from his panting heart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The reeking fibres clinging to the dart;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From the wide wound gush'd out a stream of blood,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Inflicted late by Teucer's deadly dart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Supported on his better hand he stay'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Phoebus then ('twas all he could) he pray'd:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"All-seeing monarch! whether Lycia's coast,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo! stiff with clotted blood, and pierced with pain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That thrills my arm, and shoots through every vein,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">At once his country's pillar, and their own;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A chief, who led to Troy's beleaguer'd wall</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A host of heroes, and outshined them all.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fired, they rush on; first Hector seeks the foes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And with superior vengeance greatly glows.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But o'er the dead the fierce Patroclus stands,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Jove, to swell the horrors of the fight,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, nor before, the hardy Lycians fled,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thence from the war the breathless hero bore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Veil'd in a cloud, to silver Simois' shore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There bathed his honourable wounds, and dress'd</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And with perfumes of sweet ambrosial dews</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Sleep and Death, two twins of winged race,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now Troy had stoop'd beneath his matchless power,</l>

Homeric age is upon a level with the state of navigation just
described, personal prowess decided every thing; the night attack and
the ambuscade, although much esteemed, were never upon a large scale.
The chiefs fight in advance, and enact almost as much as the knights of
romance. The siege of Troy was as little like a modern siege as a
captain in the guards is like Achilles. There is no mention of a ditch
or any other line or work round the town, and the wall itself was
accessible without a ladder. It was probably a vast mound of earth with
a declivity outwards. Patroclus thrice mounts it in armour. The Trojans
are in no respects blockaded, and receive assistance from their allies
to the very end."—Coleridge, p. 212.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His blazing aegis thrice Apollo shook;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He tried the fourth; when, bursting from the cloud,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A more than mortal voice was heard aloud.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Patroclus! cease; this heaven-defended wall</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Defies thy lance; not fated yet to fall;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy friend, thy greater far, it shall withstand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Troy shall not stoop even to Achilles' hand."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So spoke the god who darts celestial fires;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greek obeys him, and with awe retires.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Hector, checking at the Scaean gates</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His panting coursers, in his breast debates,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or in the field his forces to employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or draw the troops within the walls of Troy.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus while he thought, beside him Phoebus stood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In Asius' shape, who reigned by Sangar's flood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Thy brother, Hecuba! from Dymas sprung,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus he accosts him. "What a shameful sight!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">God! is it Hector that forbears the fight?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Were thine my vigour this successful spear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Should soon convince thee of so false a fear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Turn thee, ah turn thee to the field of fame,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And in Patroclus' blood efface thy shame.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Perhaps Apollo shall thy arms succeed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And heaven ordains him by thy lance to bleed."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So spoke the inspiring god; then took his flight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And plunged amidst the tumult of the fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He bids Cebrion drive the rapid car;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lash resounds, the coursers rush to war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The god the Grecians' sinking souls depress'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And pour'd swift spirits through each Trojan breast.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Patroclus lights, impatient for the fight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A spear his left, a stone employs his right:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With all his nerves he drives it at the foe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pointed above, and rough and gross below:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The falling ruin crush'd Cebrion's head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lawless offspring of king Priam's bed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His front, brows, eyes, one undistinguish'd wound:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bursting balls drop sightless to the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The charioteer, while yet he held the rein,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Struck from the car, falls headlong on the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To the dark shades the soul unwilling glides,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While the proud victor thus his fall derides.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Good heaven! what active feats yon artist shows!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What skilful divers are our Phrygian foes!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mark with what ease they sink into the sand!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pity that all their practice is by land!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then rushing sudden on his prostrate prize,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To spoil the carcase fierce Patroclus flies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift as a lion, terrible and bold,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That sweeps the field, depopulates the fold;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pierced through the dauntless heart, then tumbles slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And from his fatal courage finds his bane.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At once bold Hector leaping from his car,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Defends the body, and provokes the war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus for some slaughter'd hind, with equal rage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Two lordly rulers of the wood engage;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stung with fierce hunger, each the prey invades,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And echoing roars rebellow through the shades.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stern Hector fastens on the warrior's head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And by the foot Patroclus drags the dead:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While all around, confusion, rage, and fright,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mix the contending hosts in mortal fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So pent by hills, the wild winds roar aloud</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In the deep bosom of some gloomy wood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Leaves, arms, and trees, aloft in air are blown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The broad oaks crackle, and the Sylvans groan;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This way and that, the rattling thicket bends,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the whole forest in one crash descends.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not with less noise, with less tumultuous rage,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In dreadful shock the mingled hosts engage.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Darts shower'd on darts, now round the carcase ring;</l>
<pb n="309" /><anchor id="Pg309" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now flights of arrows bounding from the string:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stones follow stones; some clatter on the fields,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some hard, and heavy, shake the sounding shields.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But where the rising whirlwind clouds the plains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sunk in soft dust the mighty chief remains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, stretch'd in death, forgets the guiding reins!</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now flaming from the zenith, Sol had driven</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His fervid orb through half the vault of heaven;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While on each host with equal tempests fell</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The showering darts, and numbers sank to hell.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But when his evening wheels o'erhung the main,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Glad conquest rested on the Grecian train.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then from amidst the tumult and alarms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They draw the conquer'd corse and radiant arms.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then rash Patroclus with new fury glows,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And breathing slaughter, pours amid the foes.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thrice on the press like Mars himself he flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thrice three heroes at each onset slew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There ends thy glory! there the Fates untwine</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The last, black remnant of so bright a line:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Apollo dreadful stops thy middle way;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Death calls, and heaven allows no longer day!</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For lo! the god in dusky clouds enshrined,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Approaching dealt a staggering blow behind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The weighty shock his neck and shoulders feel;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His eyes flash sparkles, his stunn'd senses reel</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In giddy darkness; far to distance flung,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His bounding helmet on the champaign rung.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles' plume is stain'd with dust and gore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That plume which never stoop'd to earth before;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Long used, untouch'd, in fighting fields to shine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And shade the temples of the mad divine.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove dooms it now on Hector's helm to nod;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not long—for fate pursues him, and the god.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His spear in shivers falls; his ample shield</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Drops from his arm: his baldric strows the field:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The corslet his astonish'd breast forsakes:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Loose is each joint; each nerve with horror shakes;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stupid he stares, and all-assistless stands:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such is the force of more than mortal hands!</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A Dardan youth there was, well known to fame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From Panthus sprung, Euphorbus was his name;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Famed for the manage of the foaming horse,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Skill'd in the dart, and matchless in the course:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full twenty knights he tumbled from the car,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While yet he learn'd his rudiments of war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His venturous spear first drew the hero's gore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He struck, he wounded, but he durst no more.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor, though disarm'd, Patroclus' fury stood:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But swift withdrew the long-protended wood.</l>
<pb n="310" /><anchor id="Pg310" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And turn'd him short, and herded in the crowd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus, by an arm divine, and mortal spear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wounded, at once, Patroclus yields to fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Retires for succour to his social train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And flies the fate, which heaven decreed, in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stern Hector, as the bleeding chief he views,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Breaks through the ranks, and his retreat pursues:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lance arrests him with a mortal wound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He falls, earth thunders, and his arms resound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With him all Greece was sunk; that moment all</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her yet-surviving heroes seem'd to fall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So, scorch'd with heat, along the desert score,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The roaming lion meets a bristly boar,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fast by the spring; they both dispute the flood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With flaming eyes, and jaws besmear'd with blood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At length the sovereign savage wins the strife;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the torn boar resigns his thirst and life.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Patroclus thus, so many chiefs o'erthrown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So many lives effused, expires his own.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As dying now at Hector's feet he lies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He sternly views him, and triumphant cries:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Lie there, Patroclus! and with thee, the joy</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy pride once promised, of subverting Troy;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fancied scenes of Ilion wrapt in flames,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thy soft pleasures served with captive dames.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unthinking man! I fought those towers to free,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And guard that beauteous race from lords like thee:</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Return not, my brave friend (perhaps he said),</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Without the bloody arms of Hector dead.'</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Supine, and wildly gazing on the skies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With faint, expiring breath, the chief replies:</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Vain boaster! cease, and know the powers divine!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove's and Apollo's is this deed, not thine;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To heaven is owed whate'er your own you call,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Black fate o'erhangs thee, and thy hour draws nigh;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even now on life's last verge I see thee stand,</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE SEVENTH BATTLE, FOR THE BODY OF PATROCLUS.—THE ACTS OF MENELAUS.</p>

<p>Menelaus, upon the death of Patroclus, defends his body from the enemy:
Euphorbus, who attempts it, is slain. Hector advancing, Menelaus
retires; but soon returns with Ajax, and drives him off. This, Glaucus
objects to Hector as a flight, who thereupon puts on the armour he had
won from Patroclus, and renews the battle. The Greeks give way, till
Ajax rallies them: Aeneas sustains the Trojans. Aeneas and Hector
Attempt the chariot of Achilles, which is borne off by Automedon. The
horses of Achilles deplore the loss of Patroclus: Jupiter covers his
body with a thick darkness: the noble prayer of Ajax on that occasion.
Menelaus sends Antilochus to Achilles, with the news of Patroclus'
death: then returns to the fight, where, though attacked with the
utmost fury, he and Meriones, assisted by the Ajaces, bear off the body
to the ships.</p>

<p>The time is the evening of the eight-and-twentieth day. The scene lies
in the fields before Troy.</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On the cold earth divine Patroclus spread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lies pierced with wounds among the vulgar dead.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Menelaus, touch'd with generous woe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Springs to the front, and guards him from the foe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus round her new-fallen young the heifer moves,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fruit of her throes, and first-born of her loves;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And anxious (helpless as he lies, and bare)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Turns, and re-turns her, with a mother's care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Opposed to each that near the carcase came,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His broad shield glimmers, and his lances flame.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The son of Panthus, skill'd the dart to send,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Eyes the dead hero, and insults the friend.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"This hand, Atrides, laid Patroclus low;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Warrior! desist, nor tempt an equal blow:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To me the spoils my prowess won, resign:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Depart with life, and leave the glory mine"</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Atrides from the voice the storm divined,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said, and touch'd his heart. The raging pair</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pierced the thick battle, and provoke the war.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Already had stern Hector seized his head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And doom'd to Trojan gods the unhappy dead;</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meanwhile great Ajax (his broad shield display'd)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Guards the dead hero with the dreadful shade;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fast by his side the generous Spartan glows</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Glaucus, leader of the Lycian aids,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Where now in Hector shall we Hector find?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A manly form, without a manly mind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Is this, O chief! a hero's boasted fame?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How vain, without the merit, is the name!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Since battle is renounced, thy thoughts employ</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What other methods may preserve thy Troy:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis time to try if Ilion's state can stand</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their lives for you? those Lycians you forsake?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What from thy thankless arms can we expect?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy friend Sarpedon proves thy base neglect;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Say, shall our slaughter'd bodies guard your walls,</l>
<pb n="316" /><anchor id="Pg316" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While unreveng'd the great Sarpedon falls?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even where he died for Troy, you left him there,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A feast for dogs, and all the fowls of air.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On my command if any Lycian wait,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hence let him march, and give up Troy to fate.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Did such a spirit as the gods impart</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Impel one Trojan hand or Trojan heart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Such as should burn in every soul that draws</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sword for glory, and his country's cause)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even yet our mutual arms we might employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And drag yon carcase to the walls of Troy.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sarpedon's arms and honour'd corse again!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Greece with Achilles' friend should be repaid,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">But words are vain—Let Ajax once appear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Hector trembles and recedes with fear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou dar'st not meet the terrors of his eye;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And lo! already thou prepar'st to fly."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Trojan chief with fix'd resentment eyed</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Lycian leader, and sedate replied:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Say, is it just, my friend, that Hector's ear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From such a warrior such a speech should hear?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I deem'd thee once the wisest of thy kind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But ill this insult suits a prudent mind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I shun great Ajax? I desert my train?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis mine to prove the rash assertion vain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I joy to mingle where the battle bleeds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hear the thunder of the sounding steeds.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Jove's high will is ever uncontroll'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The strong he withers, and confounds the bold;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now crowns with fame the mighty man, and now</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Strikes the fresh garland from the victor's brow!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Come, through yon squadrons let us hew the way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thou be witness, if I fear to-day;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If yet a Greek the sight of Hector dread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or yet their hero dare defend the dead."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then turning to the martial hosts, he cries:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Ye Trojans, Dardans, Lycians, and allies!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Be men, my friends, in action as in name,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And yet be mindful of your ancient fame.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hector in proud Achilles' arms shall shine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Torn from his friend, by right of conquest mine."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He strode along the field, as thus he said:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The sable plumage nodded o'er his head:)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift through the spacious plain he sent a look;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One instant saw, one instant overtook</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The distant band, that on the sandy shore</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The radiant spoils to sacred Ilion bore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There his own mail unbraced the field bestrow'd;</l>
<pb n="317" /><anchor id="Pg317" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His train to Troy convey'd the massy load.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now blazing in the immortal arms he stands;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The work and present of celestial hands;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By aged Peleus to Achilles given,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As first to Peleus by the court of heaven:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His father's arms not long Achilles wears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forbid by fate to reach his father's years.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Him, proud in triumph, glittering from afar,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The god whose thunder rends the troubled air</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beheld with pity; as apart he sat,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, conscious, look'd through all the scene of fate.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He shook the sacred honours of his head;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Olympus trembled, and the godhead said;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Ah, wretched man! unmindful of thy end!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A moment's glory; and what fates attend!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In heavenly panoply divinely bright</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou stand'st, and armies tremble at thy sight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As at Achilles' self! beneath thy dart</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lies slain the great Achilles' dearer part.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou from the mighty dead those arms hast torn,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which once the greatest of mankind had worn.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">No more officious, with endearing charms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From thy tired limbs unbrace Pelides' arms!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then with his sable brow he gave the nod</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That seals his word; the sanction of the god.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The stubborn arms (by Jove's command disposed)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Conform'd spontaneous, and around him closed:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fill'd with the god, enlarged his members grew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through all his veins a sudden vigour flew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The blood in brisker tides began to roll,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Mars himself came rushing on his soul.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Exhorting loud through all the field he strode,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And look'd, and moved, Achilles, or a god.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now Mesthles, Glaucus, Medon, he inspires,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now Phorcys, Chromius, and Hippothous fires;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The great Thersilochus like fury found,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Asteropaeus kindled at the sound,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fired by his words, the troops dismiss their fears,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on the Greeks they drive in firm array,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Great Ajax mark'd the growing storm from far,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus bespoke his brother of the war:</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The warrior raised his voice, and wide around</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The field re-echoed the distressful sound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O chiefs! O princes, to whose hand is given</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rule of men; whose glory is from heaven!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whom with due honours both Atrides grace:</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oilean Ajax first the voice obey'd,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The first attack the Grecians scarce sustain,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then fierce they rally, to revenge led on</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Ajax to Peleus' son the second name,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In graceful stature next, and next in fame)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With headlong force the foremost ranks he tore;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The son of Lethus, brave Pelasgus' heir,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hippothous, dragg'd the carcase through the war;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">With thongs inserted through the double wound:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Inevitable fate o'ertakes the deed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Doom'd by great Ajax' vengeful lance to bleed:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">It cleft the helmet's brazen cheeks in twain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The shatter'd crest and horse-hair strow the plain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With nerves relax'd he tumbles to the ground:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The brain comes gushing through the ghastly wound:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He drops Patroclus' foot, and o'er him spread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now lies a sad companion of the dead:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The boldest warrior and the noblest mind:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fields resounded with his weighty fall.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Phorcys, as slain Hippothous he defends,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He lies, and grasps the dust with dying hands.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Struck at the sight, recede the Trojan train:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The shouting Argives strip the heroes slain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now had Troy, by Greece compell'd to yield,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fled to her ramparts, and resign'd the field;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Greece, in her native fortitude elate,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With Jove averse, had turn'd the scale of fate:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Phoebus urged Æneas to the fight;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus he—"What methods yet, O chief! remain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To save your Troy, though heaven its fall ordain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There have been heroes, who, by virtuous care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By valour, numbers, and by arts of war,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Have forced the powers to spare a sinking state,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gain'd at length the glorious odds of fate:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But you, when fortune smiles, when Jove declares</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His partial favour, and assists your wars,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Your shameful efforts 'gainst yourselves employ,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Æneas through the form assumed descries</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, and foremost to the combat flew:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Asteropeus with grief beheld the slain,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Indissolubly firm, around the dead,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rank within rank, on buckler buckler spread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hemm'd with bristled spears, the Grecians stood,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And in an orb contracts the crowded war,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Close in their ranks commands to fight or fall,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fix'd on the spot they war, and wounded, wound</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A sanguine torrent steeps the reeking ground:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On heaps the Greeks, on heaps the Trojans bled,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, thickening round them, rise the hills of dead.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Greece, in close order, and collected might,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet suffers least, and sways the wavering fight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce as conflicting fires the combat burns,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now it rises, now it sinks by turns.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In one thick darkness all the fight was lost;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sun, the moon, and all the ethereal host</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Seem'd as extinct: day ravish'd from their eyes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all heaven's splendours blotted from the skies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such o'er Patroclus' body hung the night,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rest in sunshine fought, and open light;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unclouded there, the aerial azure spread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No vapour rested on the mountain's head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The golden sun pour'd forth a stronger ray,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all the broad expansion flamed with day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dispersed around the plain, by fits they fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And here and there their scatter'd arrows light:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But death and darkness o'er the carcase spread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There burn'd the war, and there the mighty bled.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meanwhile the sons of Nestor, in the rear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Their fellows routed,) toss the distant spear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And skirmish wide: so Nestor gave command,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When from the ships he sent the Pylian band.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The youthful brothers thus for fame contend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor knew the fortune of Achilles' friend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In thought they view'd him still, with martial joy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Glorious in arms, and dealing death to Troy.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But round the corse the heroes pant for breath,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thick and heavy grows the work of death:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'erlabour'd now, with dust, and sweat, and gore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their knees, their legs, their feet, are covered o'er;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Drops follow drops, the clouds on clouds arise,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The mangled body bathed in sweat and blood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Greeks and Ilians equal strength employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now to the ships to force it, now to Troy.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not Pallas' self, her breast when fury warms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor he whose anger sets the world in arms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Could blame this scene; such rage, such horror reign'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such, Jove to honour the great dead ordain'd.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles in his ships at distance lay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor knew the fatal fortune of the day;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He, yet unconscious of Patroclus' fall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In dust extended under Ilion's wall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Expects him glorious from the conquered plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And for his wish'd return prepares in vain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though well he knew, to make proud Ilion bend</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Was more than heaven had destined to his friend.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Perhaps to him: this Thetis had reveal'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rest, in pity to her son, conceal'd.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still raged the conflict round the hero dead,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And heaps on heaps by mutual wounds they bled.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Cursed be the man (even private Greeks would say)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who dares desert this well-disputed day!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">First may the cleaving earth before our eyes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Gape wide, and drink our blood for sacrifice;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">First perish all, ere haughty Troy shall boast</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">We lost Patroclus, and our glory lost!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus they: while with one voice the Trojans said,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now at Automedon the Trojan foe</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">There stood a Trojan, not unknown to fame,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">High from the ground the warriors heave the dead.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A general clamour rises at the sight:</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE GRIEF OF ACHILLES, AND NEW ARMOUR MADE HIM BY VULCAN.</p>

<p>The news of the death of Patroclus is brought to Achilles by
Antilochus. Thetis, hearing his lamentations, comes with all her sea-
nymphs to comfort him. The speeches of the mother and son on this
occasion. Iris appears to Achilles by the command of Juno, and orders
him to show himself at the head of the intrenchments. The sight of him
turns the fortunes of the day, and the body of Patroclus is carried off
by the Greeks. The Trojans call a council, where Hector and Polydamas
disagree in their opinions: but the advice of the former prevails, to
remain encamped in the field. The grief of Achilles over the body of
Patroclus.</p>

<p>Thetis goes to the palace of Vulcan to obtain new arms for her son. The
description of the wonderful works of Vulcan: and, lastly, that noble
one of the shield of Achilles.</p>

<p>The latter part of the nine-and-twentieth day, and the night ensuing,
take up this book: the scene is at Achilles' tent on the sea-shore,
from whence it changes to the palace of Vulcan.</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus like the rage of fire the combat burns,<note place="foot"><p>This is connected with the earlier part of last book, the
regular narrative being interrupted by the message of Antilochus and
the lamentations of Achilles.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now it rises, now it sinks by turns.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meanwhile, where Hellespont's broad waters flow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stood Nestor's son, the messenger of woe:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There sat Achilles, shaded by his sails,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On hoisted yards extended to the gales;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pensive he sat; for all that fate design'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rose in sad prospect to his boding mind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus to his soul he said: "Ah! what constrains</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greeks, late victors, now to quit the plains?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Is this the day, which heaven so long ago</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ordain'd, to sink me with the weight of woe?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(So Thetis warn'd;) when by a Trojan hand</l>

compared this with the description of the shield of Hercules by Hesiod.
He remarks that, "with two or three exceptions, the imagery differs in
little more than the names and arrangements; and the difference of
arrangement in the Shield of Hercules is altogether for the worse. The
natural consecution of the Homeric images needs no exposition: it
constitutes in itself one of the beauties of the work. The Hesiodic
images are huddled together without connection or congruity: Mars
and Pallas are awkwardly introduced among the Centaurs and Lapithae;—
but the gap is wide indeed between them and Apollo with the Muses,
waking the echoes of Olympus to celestial harmonies; whence however, we
are hurried back to Perseus, the Gorgons, and other images of war, over
an arm of the sea, in which the sporting dolphins, the fugitive fishes,
and the fisherman on the shore with his casting net, are minutely
represented. As to the Hesiodic images themselves, the leading remark
is, that they catch at beauty by ornament, and at sublimity by
exaggeration; and upon the untenable supposition of the genuineness of
this poem, there is this curious peculiarity, that, in the description
of scenes of rustic peace, the superiority of Homer is decisive—while
in those of war and tumult it may be thought, perhaps, that the
Hesiodic poet has more than once the advantage."</p></note></l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE RECONCILIATION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.</p>

<p>Thetis brings to her son the armour made by Vulcan. She preserves the
body of his friend from corruption, and commands him to assemble the
army, to declare his resentment at an end. Agamemnon and Achilles are
solemnly reconciled: the speeches, presents, and ceremonies on that
occasion. Achilles is with great difficulty persuaded to refrain from
the battle till the troops have refreshed themselves by the advice of
Ulysses. The presents are conveyed to the tent of Achilles, where
Briseis laments over the body of Patroclus. The hero obstinately
refuses all repast, and gives himself up to lamentations for his
friend. Minerva descends to strengthen him, by the order of Jupiter. He
arms for the fight: his appearance described. He addresses himself to
his horses, and reproaches them with the death of Patroclus. One of
them is miraculously endued with voice, and inspired to prophesy his
fate: but the hero, not astonished by that prodigy, rushes with fury to
the combat.</p>

<p>The thirteenth day. The scene is on the sea-shore.</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon as Aurora heaved her Orient head</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Above the waves, that blush'd with early red,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(With new-born day to gladden mortal sight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The immortal arms the goddess-mother bears</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift to her son: her son she finds in tears</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stretch'd o'er Patroclus' corse; while all the rest</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their sovereign's sorrows in their own express'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A ray divine her heavenly presence shed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus, his hand soft touching, Thetis said:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Suppress, my son, this rage of grief, and know</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">On all the immortal artist had design'd.</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Goddess! (he cried,) these glorious arms, that shine</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With matchless art, confess the hand divine.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now to the bloody battle let me bend:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But ah! the relics of my slaughter'd friend!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In those wide wounds through which his spirit fled,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall flies, and worms obscene, pollute the dead?"</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fresh as in life, the carcase of the slain.</l>

familiar to the old epic poets, both the distinguishing attributes and
the endless toil and endurances of Heracles, the most renowned
subjugator of all the semi-divine personages worshipped by the
Hellenes,—a being of irresistible force, and especially beloved by
Zeus, yet condemned constantly to labour for others and to
obey the commands of a worthless and cowardly persecutor. His
recompense is reserved to the close of his career, when his afflicting
trials are brought to a close: he is then admitted to the godhead, and
receives in marriage Hebe."—Grote, vol. i. p. 128.</p></note></l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">He grinds his teeth, and furious with delay</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'erlooks the embattled host, and hopes the bloody day.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The silver cuishes first his thighs infold;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then o'er his breast was braced the hollow gold;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The brazen sword a various baldric tied,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That, starr'd with gems, hung glittering at his side;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, like the moon, the broad refulgent shield</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Blazed with long rays, and gleam'd athwart the field.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So to night-wandering sailors, pale with fears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wide o'er the watery waste, a light appears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Which on the far-seen mountain blazing high,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Streams from some lonely watch-tower to the sky:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With mournful eyes they gaze, and gaze again;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Loud howls the storm, and drives them o'er the main.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next, his high head the helmet graced; behind</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sweepy crest hung floating in the wind:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like the red star, that from his flaming hair</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shakes down diseases, pestilence, and war;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So stream'd the golden honours from his head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Trembled the sparkling plumes, and the loose glories shed.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The chief beholds himself with wondering eyes;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His arms he poises, and his motions tries;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Buoy'd by some inward force, he seems to swim,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And feels a pinion lifting every limb.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now he shakes his great paternal spear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ponderous and huge, which not a Greek could rear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From Pelion's cloudy top an ash entire</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Old Chiron fell'd, and shaped it for his sire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A spear which stern Achilles only wields,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The death of heroes, and the dread of fields.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Automedon and Alcimus prepare</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The immortal coursers, and the radiant car;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The silver traces sweeping at their side;)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their fiery mouths resplendent bridles tied;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The ivory-studded reins, return'd behind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Waved o'er their backs, and to the chariot join'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The charioteer then whirl'd the lash around,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And swift ascended at one active bound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All bright in heavenly arms, above his squire</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles mounts, and sets the field on fire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not brighter Phoebus in the ethereal way</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Flames from his chariot, and restores the day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High o'er the host, all terrible he stands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thunders to his steeds these dread commands:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Xanthus and Balius! of Podarges' strain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Unless ye boast that heavenly race in vain,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Be swift, be mindful of the load ye bear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And learn to make your master more your care:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through falling squadrons bear my slaughtering sword,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor, as ye left Patroclus, leave your lord."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The generous Xanthus, as the words he said,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Seem'd sensible of woe, and droop'd his head:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Trembling he stood before the golden wain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bow'd to dust the honours of his mane.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When, strange to tell! (so Juno will'd) he broke</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Eternal silence, and portentous spoke.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Achilles! yes! this day at least we bear</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy rage in safety through the files of war:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But come it will, the fatal time must come,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not ours the fault, but God decrees thy doom.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not through our crime, or slowness in the course,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fell thy Patroclus, but by heavenly force;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bright far-shooting god who gilds the day</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Confess'd we saw him) tore his arms way.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No—could our swiftness o'er the winds prevail,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or beat the pinions of the western gale,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All were in vain—the Fates thy death demand,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then ceased for ever, by the Furies tied,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His fateful voice. The intrepid chief replied</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With unabated rage—"So let it be!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Portents and prodigies are lost on me.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I know my fate: to die, to see no more</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">My much-loved parents, and my native shore—</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Enough—when heaven ordains, I sink in night:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now perish Troy!" He said, and rush'd to fight.</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE BATTLE OF THE GODS, AND THE ACTS OF ACHILLES.</p>

<p>Jupiter, upon Achilles' return to the battle, calls a council of the
gods, and permits them to assist either party. The terrors of the
combat described, when the deities are engaged. Apollo encourages
Æneas to meet Achilles. After a long conversation, these two heroes
encounter; but Æneas is preserved by the assistance of Neptune.
Achilles falls upon the rest of the Trojans, and is upon the point of
killing Hector, but Apollo conveys him away in a cloud. Achilles
pursues the Trojans with a great slaughter.</p>

<p>The same day continues. The scene is in the field before Troy.</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus round Pelides breathing war and blood</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Greece, sheathed in arms, beside her vessels stood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While near impending from a neighbouring height,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Troy's black battalions wait the shock of fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then Jove to Themis gives command, to call</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gods to council in the starry hall:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift o'er Olympus' hundred hills she flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And summons all the senate of the skies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These shining on, in long procession come</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Jove's eternal adamantine dome.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not one was absent, not a rural power</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That haunts the verdant gloom, or rosy bower;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each fair-hair'd dryad of the shady wood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each azure sister of the silver flood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All but old Ocean, hoary sire! who keeps</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His ancient seat beneath the sacred deeps.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On marble thrones, with lucid columns crown'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The work of Vulcan,) sat the powers around.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even he whose trident sways the watery reign</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heard the loud summons, and forsook the main,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Assumed his throne amid the bright abodes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And question'd thus the sire of men and gods:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What moves the god who heaven and earth commands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And grasps the thunder in his awful hands,</l>
<pb n="361" /><anchor id="Pg361" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus to convene the whole ethereal state?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Is Greece and Troy the subject in debate?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Already met, the louring hosts appear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And death stands ardent on the edge of war."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"'Tis true (the cloud-compelling power replies)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This day we call the council of the skies</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In care of human race; even Jove's own eye</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sees with regret unhappy mortals die.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far on Olympus' top in secret state</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ourself will sit, and see the hand of fate</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Work out our will. Celestial powers! descend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And as your minds direct, your succour lend</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To either host. Troy soon must lie o'erthrown,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If uncontroll'd Achilles fights alone:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their troops but lately durst not meet his eyes;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What can they now, if in his rage he rise?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Assist them, gods! or Ilion's sacred wall</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">May fall this day, though fate forbids the fall."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said, and fired their heavenly breasts with rage.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On adverse parts the warring gods engage:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heaven's awful queen; and he whose azure round</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Girds the vast globe; the maid in arms renown'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hermes, of profitable arts the sire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Vulcan, the black sovereign of the fire:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These to the fleet repair with instant flight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The vessels tremble as the gods alight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In aid of Troy, Latona, Phoebus came,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mars fiery-helm'd, the laughter-loving dame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Xanthus, whose streams in golden currents flow,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the chaste huntress of the silver bow.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ere yet the gods their various aid employ,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each Argive bosom swell'd with manly joy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While great Achilles (terror of the plain),</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Long lost to battle, shone in arms again.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dreadful he stood in front of all his host;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pale Troy beheld, and seem'd already lost;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her bravest heroes pant with inward fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And trembling see another god of war.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But when the powers descending swell'd the fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then tumult rose: fierce rage and pale affright</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Varied each face: then Discord sounds alarms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Earth echoes, and the nations rush to arms.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now through the trembling shores Minerva calls,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now she thunders from the Grecian walls.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mars hovering o'er his Troy, his terror shrouds</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In gloomy tempests, and a night of clouds:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now through each Trojan heart he fury pours</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With voice divine, from Ilion's topmost towers:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now shouts to Simois, from her beauteous hill;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The mountain shook, the rapid stream stood still.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Æneas was the first who dared to stay;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where'er he moved, the goddess shone before,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bathed his brazen lance in hostile gore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What mortal man Achilles can sustain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The immortals guard him through the dreadful plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And suffer not his dart to fall in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Were God my aid, this arm should check his power,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forth through the navel burst the thrilling steel;</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.<note place="foot"><p>"Perhaps the boldest
excursion of Homer into this region of poetical fancy is the collision
into which, in the twenty-first of the Iliad, he has brought the river
god Scamander, first with Achilles, and afterwards with Vulcan, when
summoned by Juno to the hero's aid. The overwhelming fury of the stream
finds the natural interpretation in the character of the mountain
torrents of Greece and Asia Minor. Their wide, shingly beds are in
summer comparatively dry, so as to be easily forded by the foot
passenger. But a thunder-shower in the mountains, unobserved perhaps by
the traveller on the plain, may suddenly immerse him in the flood of a
mighty river. The rescue of Achilles by the fiery arms of Vulcan
scarcely admits of the same ready explanation from physical causes. Yet
the subsiding of the flood at the critical moment when the hero's
destruction appeared imminent, might, by a slight extension of the
figurative parallel, be ascribed to a god symbolic of the influences
opposed to all atmospheric moisture."—Mure, vol. i. p. 480, sq.</p></note></p>

<p>The Trojans fly before Achilles, some towards the town, others to the
river Scamander: he falls upon the latter with great slaughter: takes
twelve captives alive, to sacrifice to the shade of Patroclus; and
kills Lycaon and Asteropeus. Scamander attacks him with all his waves:
Neptune and Pallas assist the hero: Simois joins Scamander: at length
Vulcan, by the instigation of Juno, almost dries up the river. This
Combat ended, the other gods engage each other. Meanwhile Achilles
continues the slaughter, drives the rest into Troy: Agenor only makes a
stand, and is conveyed away in a cloud by Apollo; who (to delude
Achilles) takes upon him Agenor's shape, and while he pursues him in
that disguise, gives the Trojans an opportunity of retiring into their
city.</p>

<p>The same day continues. The scene is on the banks and in the stream of
Scamander.</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now to Xanthus' gliding stream they drove,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Xanthus, immortal progeny of Jove.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The river here divides the flying train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Part to the town fly diverse o'er the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where late their troops triumphant bore the fight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now chased, and trembling in ignoble flight:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(These with a gathered mist Saturnia shrouds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And rolls behind the rout a heap of clouds:)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Part plunge into the stream: old Xanthus roars,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The flashing billows beat the whiten'd shores:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With cries promiscuous all the banks resound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And here, and there, in eddies whirling round,</l>
<pb n="375" /><anchor id="Pg375" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The flouncing steeds and shrieking warriors drown'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As the scorch'd locusts from their fields retire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While fast behind them runs the blaze of fire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Driven from the land before the smoky cloud,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The clustering legions rush into the flood:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So, plunged in Xanthus by Achilles' force,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Roars the resounding surge with men and horse.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His bloody lance the hero casts aside,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Which spreading tamarisks on the margin hide,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, like a god, the rapid billows braves,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Arm'd with his sword, high brandish'd o'er the waves:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now down he plunges, now he whirls it round,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deep groan'd the waters with the dying sound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Repeated wounds the reddening river dyed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the warm purple circled on the tide.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift through the foamy flood the Trojans fly,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And close in rocks or winding caverns lie:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So the huge dolphin tempesting the main,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In shoals before him fly the scaly train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Confusedly heap'd they seek their inmost caves,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or pant and heave beneath the floating waves.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now, tired with slaughter, from the Trojan band</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Twelve chosen youths he drags alive to land;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With their rich belts their captive arms restrains</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Late their proud ornaments, but now their chains).</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These his attendants to the ships convey'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sad victims destined to Patroclus' shade;</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, as once more he plunged amid the flood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The young Lycaon in his passage stood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The son of Priam; whom the hero's hand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But late made captive in his father's land</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(As from a sycamore, his sounding steel</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lopp'd the green arms to spoke a chariot wheel)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Lemnos' isle he sold the royal slave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where Jason's son the price demanded gave;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But kind Eetion, touching on the shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The ransom'd prince to fair Arisbe bore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ten days were past, since in his father's reign</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He felt the sweets of liberty again;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The next, that god whom men in vain withstand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Gives the same youth to the same conquering hand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now never to return! and doom'd to go</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A sadder journey to the shades below.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His well-known face when great Achilles eyed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The helm and visor he had cast aside</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With wild affright, and dropp'd upon the field</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His useless lance and unavailing shield,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As trembling, panting, from the stream he fled,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And knock'd his faltering knees, the hero said.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Ye mighty gods! what wonders strike my view!</l>
<pb n="376" /><anchor id="Pg376" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Is it in vain our conquering arms subdue?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sure I shall see yon heaps of Trojans kill'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rise from the shades, and brave me on the field;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As now the captive, whom so late I bound</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sold to Lemnos, stalks on Trojan ground!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not him the sea's unmeasured deeps detain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That bar such numbers from their native plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo! he returns. Try, then, my flying spear!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Try, if the grave can hold the wanderer;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If earth, at length this active prince can seize,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Earth, whose strong grasp has held down Hercules."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus while he spoke, the Trojan pale with fears</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Approach'd, and sought his knees with suppliant tears</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Loth as he was to yield his youthful breath,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And his soul shivering at the approach of death.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles raised the spear, prepared to wound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He kiss'd his feet, extended on the ground:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And while, above, the spear suspended stood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Longing to dip its thirsty point in blood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One hand embraced them close, one stopp'd the dart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While thus these melting words attempt his heart:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Thy well-known captive, great Achilles! see,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Once more Lycaon trembles at thy knee.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some pity to a suppliant's name afford,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who shared the gifts of Ceres at thy board;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whom late thy conquering arm to Lemnos bore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far from his father, friends, and native shore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A hundred oxen were his price that day,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now sums immense thy mercy shall repay.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Scarce respited from woes I yet appear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And scarce twelve morning suns have seen me here;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo! Jove again submits me to thy hands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Again, her victim cruel Fate demands!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I sprang from Priam, and Laothoe fair,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Old Altes' daughter, and Lelegia's heir;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who held in Pedasus his famed abode,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And ruled the fields where silver Satnio flow'd,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Two sons (alas! unhappy sons) she bore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For ah! one spear shall drink each brother's gore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And I succeed to slaughter'd Polydore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How from that arm of terror shall I fly?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some demon urges! 'tis my doom to die!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If ever yet soft pity touch'd thy mind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ah! think not me too much of Hector's kind!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not the same mother gave thy suppliant breath,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With his, who wrought thy loved Patroclus' death."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These words, attended with a shower of tears,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The youth address'd to unrelenting ears:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Talk not of life, or ransom (he replies):</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Patroclus dead, whoever meets me, dies:</l>
<pb n="377" /><anchor id="Pg377" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain a single Trojan sues for grace;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But least, the sons of Priam's hateful race.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Die then, my friend! what boots it to deplore?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The great, the good Patroclus is no more!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He, far thy better, was foredoom'd to die,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thou, dost thou bewail mortality?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Seest thou not me, whom nature's gifts adorn,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sprung from a hero, from a goddess born?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The day shall come (which nothing can avert)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When by the spear, the arrow, or the dart,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By night, or day, by force, or by design,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Impending death and certain fate are mine!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Die then,"—He said; and as the word he spoke,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fainting stripling sank before the stroke:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His hand forgot its grasp, and left the spear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While all his trembling frame confess'd his fear:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sudden, Achilles his broad sword display'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And buried in his neck the reeking blade.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prone fell the youth; and panting on the land,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gushing purple dyed the thirsty sand.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The victor to the stream the carcase gave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus insults him, floating on the wave:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Lie there, Lycaon! let the fish surround</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy bloated corpse, and suck thy gory wound:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There no sad mother shall thy funerals weep,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But swift Scamander roll thee to the deep,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose every wave some watery monster brings,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To feast unpunish'd on the fat of kings.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So perish Troy, and all the Trojan line!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such ruin theirs, and such compassion mine.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What boots ye now Scamander's worshipp'd stream,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">In vain your immolated bulls are slain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Your living coursers glut his gulfs in vain!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus he rewards you, with this bitter fate;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus, till the Grecian vengeance is complete:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus is atoned Patroclus' honour'd shade,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the short absence of Achilles paid."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These boastful words provoked the raging god;</l>

<pb n="378" /><anchor id="Pg378" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The flood impell'd him, on Pelides' head</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To avenge his waters choked with heaps of dead.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Near as they drew, Achilles thus began:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What art thou, boldest of the race of man?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who, or from whence? Unhappy is the sire</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose son encounters our resistless ire."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O son of Peleus! what avails to trace</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Replied the warrior) our illustrious race?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From rich Paeonia's valleys I command,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Arm'd with protended spears, my native band;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now shines the tenth bright morning since I came</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In aid of Ilion to the fields of fame:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Axius, who swells with all the neighbouring rills,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And wide around the floated region fills,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Begot my sire, whose spear much glory won:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now lift thy arm, and try that hero's son!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Threatening he said: the hostile chiefs advance;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At once Asteropeus discharged each lance,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(For both his dexterous hands the lance could wield,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One struck, but pierced not, the Vulcanian shield;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One razed Achilles' hand; the spouting blood</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Spun forth; in earth the fasten'd weapon stood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like lightning next the Pelean javelin flies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Its erring fury hiss'd along the skies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Deep in the swelling bank was driven the spear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even to the middle earth; and quiver'd there.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then from his side the sword Pelides drew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And on his foe with double fury flew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The foe thrice tugg'd, and shook the rooted wood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Repulsive of his might the weapon stood:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fourth, he tries to break the spear in vain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bent as he stands, he tumbles to the plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His belly open'd with a ghastly wound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The reeking entrails pour upon the ground.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath the hero's feet he panting lies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And his eye darkens, and his spirit flies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While the proud victor thus triumphing said,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His radiant armour tearing from the dead:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"So ends thy glory! Such the fate they prove,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who strive presumptuous with the sons of Jove!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sprung from a river, didst thou boast thy line?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But great Saturnius is the source of mine.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">How durst thou vaunt thy watery progeny?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of Peleus, Æacus, and Jove, am I.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The race of these superior far to those,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As he that thunders to the stream that flows.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What rivers can, Scamander might have shown;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Jove he dreads, nor wars against his son.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The eternal ocean, from whose fountains flow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The seas, the rivers, and the springs below,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The thundering voice of Jove abhors to hear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And in his deep abysses shakes with fear."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said: then from the bank his javelin tore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And left the breathless warrior in his gore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The floating tides the bloody carcase lave,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And beat against it, wave succeeding wave;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till, roll'd between the banks, it lies the food</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of curling eels, and fishes of the flood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All scatter'd round the stream (their mightiest slain)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The amazed Paeonians scour along the plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He vents his fury on the flying crew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thrasius, Astyplus, and Mnesus slew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mydon, Thersilochus, with Ænius, fell;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And numbers more his lance had plunged to hell,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But from the bottom of his gulfs profound</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Scamander spoke; the shores return'd the sound.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O first of mortals! (for the gods are thine)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In valour matchless, and in force divine!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If Jove have given thee every Trojan head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis not on me thy rage should heap the dead.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">See! my choked streams no more their course can keep,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor roll their wonted tribute to the deep.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Turn then, impetuous! from our injured flood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Content, thy slaughters could amaze a god."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In human form, confess'd before his eyes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The river thus; and thus the chief replies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"O sacred stream! thy word we shall obey;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But not till Troy the destined vengeance pay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not till within her towers the perjured train</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall pant, and tremble at our arms again;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not till proud Hector, guardian of her wall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or stain this lance, or see Achilles fall."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said; and drove with fury on the foe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then to the godhead of the silver bow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The yellow flood began: "O son of Jove!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Was not the mandate of the sire above</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full and express, that Phoebus should employ</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His sacred arrows in defence of Troy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And make her conquer, till Hyperion's fall</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke in vain—The chief without dismay</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ploughs through the boiling surge his desperate way.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then rising in his rage above the shores,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From all his deep the bellowing river roars,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Huge heaps of slain disgorges on the coast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And round the banks the ghastly dead are toss'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While all before, the billows ranged on high,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(A watery bulwark,) screen the bands who fly.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now bursting on his head with thundering sound,</l>
<pb n="380" /><anchor id="Pg380" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The falling deluge whelms the hero round:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His loaded shield bends to the rushing tide;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His feet, upborne, scarce the strong flood divide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sliddering, and staggering. On the border stood</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A spreading elm, that overhung the flood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He seized a bending bough, his steps to stay;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The plant uprooted to his weight gave way.<note place="foot"><p>Wood has observed, that "the circumstance of a falling tree,
which is described as reaching from one of its banks to the other,
affords a very just idea of the breadth of the Scamander."</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heaving the bank, and undermining all;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Loud flash the waters to the rushing fall</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of the thick foliage. The large trunk display'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bridged the rough flood across: the hero stay'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On this his weight, and raised upon his hand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Leap'd from the channel, and regain'd the land.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then blacken'd the wild waves: the murmur rose:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The god pursues, a huger billow throws,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bursts the bank, ambitious to destroy</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The man whose fury is the fate of Troy.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He like the warlike eagle speeds his pace</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Swiftest and strongest of the aerial race);</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far as a spear can fly, Achilles springs;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">At every bound his clanging armour rings:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now here, now there, he turns on every side,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And winds his course before the following tide;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The waves flow after, wheresoe'er he wheels,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gather fast, and murmur at his heels.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So when a peasant to his garden brings</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soft rills of water from the bubbling springs,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And calls the floods from high, to bless his bowers,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And feed with pregnant streams the plants and flowers:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon as he clears whate'er their passage stay'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And marks the future current with his spade,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift o'er the rolling pebbles, down the hills,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Louder and louder purl the falling rills;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before him scattering, they prevent his pains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And shine in mazy wanderings o'er the plains.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still flies Achilles, but before his eyes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still swift Scamander rolls where'er he flies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not all his speed escapes the rapid floods;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The first of men, but not a match for gods.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oft as he turn'd the torrent to oppose,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And bravely try if all the powers were foes;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So oft the surge, in watery mountains spread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beats on his back, or bursts upon his head.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet dauntless still the adverse flood he braves,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And still indignant bounds above the waves.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wash'd from beneath him slides the slimy soil;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When thus (his eyes on heaven's expansion thrown)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forth bursts the hero with an angry groan:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Is there no god Achilles to befriend,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prevent, O Jove! this ignominious date,<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">Ignominious.</hi> Drowning, as compared with a death in
the field of battle, was considered utterly disgraceful.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And make my future life the sport of fate.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of all heaven's oracles believed in vain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But most of Thetis must her son complain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By Phoebus' darts she prophesied my fall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In glorious arms before the Trojan wall.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oh! had I died in fields of battle warm,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stretch'd like a hero, by a hero's arm!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Might Hector's spear this dauntless bosom rend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And my swift soul o'ertake my slaughter'd friend.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ah no! Achilles meets a shameful fate,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oh how unworthy of the brave and great!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like some vile swain, whom on a rainy day,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Crossing a ford, the torrent sweeps away,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">An unregarded carcase to the sea."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Neptune and Pallas haste to his relief,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus in human form address'd the chief:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The power of ocean first: "Forbear thy fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O son of Peleus! Lo, thy gods appear!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behold! from Jove descending to thy aid,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Propitious Neptune, and the blue-eyed maid.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stay, and the furious flood shall cease to rave</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis not thy fate to glut his angry wave.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But thou, the counsel heaven suggests, attend!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor breathe from combat, nor thy sword suspend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till Troy receive her flying sons, till all</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Her routed squadrons pant behind their wall:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hector alone shall stand his fatal chance,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Hector's blood shall smoke upon thy lance.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thine is the glory doom'd." Thus spake the gods:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then swift ascended to the bright abodes.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stung with new ardour, thus by heaven impell'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He springs impetuous, and invades the field:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er all the expanded plain the waters spread;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Floating 'midst scatter'd arms; while casques of gold</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And turn'd-up bucklers glitter'd as they roll'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High o'er the surging tide, by leaps and bounds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He wades, and mounts; the parted wave resounds.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not a whole river stops the hero's course,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While Pallas fills him with immortal force.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With equal rage, indignant Xanthus roars,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And lifts his billows, and o'erwhelms his shores.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heaven in loud thunder bids the trumpet sound;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Jove, as his sport, the dreadful scene descries,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And views contending gods with careless eyes.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The power of battles lifts his brazen spear,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He spoke, and smote the long-resounding shield,</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then heaved the goddess in her mighty hand</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A stone, the limit of the neighbouring land,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">This at the heavenly homicide she cast.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thundering he falls, a mass of monstrous size:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The stunning stroke his stubborn nerves unbound:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Loud o'er the fields his ringing arms resound:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The scornful dame her conquest views with smiles,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, glorying, thus the prostrate god reviles:</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The goddess spoke, and turn'd her eyes away,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lent to the wounded god her tender hand:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Slowly he rises, scarcely breathes with pain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, propp'd on her fair arm, forsakes the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This the bright empress of the heavens survey'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, scoffing, thus to war's victorious maid:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">She moves: let Pallas, if she dares, pursue."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Minerva smiling heard, the pair o'ertook,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And slightly on her breast the wanton strook:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She, unresisting, fell (her spirits fled);</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On earth together lay the lovers spread.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through blood, through death, Achilles still proceeds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er slaughter'd heroes, and o'er rolling steeds.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As when avenging flames with fury driven</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On guilty towns exert the wrath of heaven;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The pale inhabitants, some fall, some fly;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the red vapours purple all the sky:</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High on a turret hoary Priam stands,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus charged the reverend monarch: wide were flung</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Struck slaughter back, and cover'd the retreat,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gladsome see their last escape from fate.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thither, all parch'd with thirst, a heartless train,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hoary with dust, they beat the hollow plain:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gasping, panting, fainting, labour on</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With heavier strides, that lengthen toward the town.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Enraged Achilles follows with his spear;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wild with revenge, insatiable of war.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then had the Greeks eternal praise acquired,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Troy inglorious to her walls retired;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But he, the god who darts ethereal flame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shot down to save her, and redeem her fame:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To young Agenor force divine he gave;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Antenor's offspring, haughty, bold, and brave;)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In aid of him, beside the beech he sate,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And wrapt in clouds, restrain'd the hand of fate.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When now the generous youth Achilles spies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thick beats his heart, the troubled motions rise.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(So, ere a storm, the waters heave and roll.)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He stops, and questions thus his mighty soul;</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"What, shall I fly this terror of the plain!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like others fly, and be like others slain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vain hope! to shun him by the self-same road</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yon line of slaughter'd Trojans lately trod.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No: with the common heap I scorn to fall—</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What if they pass'd me to the Trojan wall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While I decline to yonder path, that leads</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To Ida's forests and surrounding shades?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So may I reach, conceal'd, the cooling flood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From my tired body wash the dirt and blood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As soon as night her dusky veil extends,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Return in safety to my Trojan friends.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What if?—But wherefore all this vain debate?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stand I to doubt, within the reach of fate?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even now perhaps, ere yet I turn the wall,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fierce Achilles sees me, and I fall:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such is his swiftness, 'tis in vain to fly,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And such his valour, that who stands must die.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Howe'er 'tis better, fighting for the state,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Here, and in public view, to meet my fate.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet sure he too is mortal; he may feel</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Like all the sons of earth) the force of steel.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One only soul informs that dreadful frame:</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said, and stood, collected, in his might;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">So from some deep-grown wood a panther starts,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Roused from his thicket by a storm of darts:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">On their whole war, untamed, the savage flies;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath the pointed steel; but safe from harms</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He stands impassive in the ethereal arms.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then fiercely rushing on the daring foe,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meanwhile the god, to cover their escape,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Assumes Agenor's habit, voice and shape,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Twas tumult all, and violence of flight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sudden joy confused, and mix'd affright.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pale Troy against Achilles shuts her gate:</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE DEATH OF HECTOR.</p>

<p>The Trojans being safe within the walls, Hector only stays to oppose
Achilles. Priam is struck at his approach, and tries to persuade his
son to re-enter the town. Hecuba joins her entreaties, but in vain.
Hector consults within himself what measures to take; but at the
advance of Achilles, his resolution fails him, and he flies. Achilles
pursues him thrice round the walls of Troy. The gods debate concerning
the fate of Hector; at length Minerva descends to the aid of Achilles.
She deludes Hector in the shape of Deiphobus; he stands the combat, and
is slain. Achilles drags the dead body at his chariot in the sight of
Priam and Hecuba. Their lamentations, tears, and despair. Their cries
reach the ears of Andromache, who, ignorant of this, was retired into
the inner part of the palace: she mounts up to the walls, and beholds
her dead husband. She swoons at the spectacle. Her excess of grief and
lamentation.</p>

<p>The thirtieth day still continues. The scene lies under the walls, and
on the battlements of Troy.</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus to their bulwarks, smit with panic fear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The herded Ilians rush like driven deer:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There safe they wipe the briny drops away,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And drown in bowls the labours of the day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Close to the walls, advancing o'er the fields</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Beneath one roof of well-compacted shields,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">March, bending on, the Greeks' embodied powers,</l>

Trojans to possess themselves of the body, which was however rescued
and borne off to the Grecian camp by the valour of Ajax and Ulysses.
Thetis stole away the body, just as the Greeks were about to burn it
with funeral honours, and conveyed it away to a renewed life of
immortality in the isle of Leuke in the Euxine.</p></note></l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.<note place="foot"><p>This book has been
closely imitated by Virgil in his fifth book, but it is almost useless
to attempt a selection of passages for comparison.</p></note></p>

<p>Achilles and the Myrmidons do honours to the body of Patroclus. After
the funeral feast he retires to the sea-shore, where, falling asleep,
the ghost of his friend appears to him, and demands the rites of
burial; the next morning the soldiers are sent with mules and waggons
to fetch wood for the pyre. The funeral procession, and the offering
their hair to the dead. Achilles sacrifices several animals, and lastly
twelve Trojan captives, at the pile; then sets fire to it. He pays
libations to the Winds, which (at the instance of Iris) rise, and raise
the flames. When the pile has burned all night, they gather the bones,
place them in an urn of gold, and raise the tomb. Achilles institutes
the funeral games: the chariot-race, the fight of the caestus, the
wrestling, the foot-race, the single combat, the discus, the shooting
with arrows, the darting the javelin: the various descriptions of
which, and the various success of the several antagonists, make the
greatest part of the book.</p>

<p>In this book ends the thirtieth day. The night following, the ghost of
Patroclus appears to Achilles: the one-and-thirtieth day is employed in
felling the timber for the pile: the two-and-thirtieth in burning it;
and the three-and-thirtieth in the games. The scene is generally on the
sea-shore.</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus humbled in the dust, the pensive train</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through the sad city mourn'd her hero slain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The body soil'd with dust, and black with gore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lies on broad Hellespont's resounding shore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Grecians seek their ships, and clear the strand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All, but the martial Myrmidonian band:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These yet assembled great Achilles holds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the stern purpose of his mind unfolds:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Not yet, my brave companions of the war,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Release your smoking coursers from the car;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But, with his chariot each in order led,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Perform due honours to Patroclus dead.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ere yet from rest or food we seek relief,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some rites remain, to glut our rage of grief."</l>

funerals. The Romans had the same custom, which they called

renewed these same honours to the memory of Achilles himself.</p></note></l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Achilles first) their coursers round the dead;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thrice their sorrows and laments renew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Tears bathe their arms, and tears the sands bedew.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For such a warrior Thetis aids their woe,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Melts their strong hearts, and bids their eyes to flow.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But chief, Pelides: thick-succeeding sighs</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Burst from his heart, and torrents from his eyes:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His slaughtering hands, yet red with blood, he laid</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On his dead friend's cold breast, and thus he said:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"All hail, Patroclus! let thy honour'd ghost</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hear, and rejoice on Pluto's dreary coast;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behold! Achilles' promise is complete;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bloody Hector stretch'd before thy feet.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lo! to the dogs his carcase I resign;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And twelve sad victims, of the Trojan line,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sacred to vengeance, instant shall expire;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their lives effused around thy funeral pyre."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Gloomy he said, and (horrible to view)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before the bier the bleeding Hector threw,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prone on the dust. The Myrmidons around</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unbraced their armour, and the steeds unbound.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All to Achilles' sable ship repair,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Frequent and full, the genial feast to share.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now from the well-fed swine black smokes aspire,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The bristly victims hissing o'er the fire:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The huge ox bellowing falls; with feebler cries</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Expires the goat; the sheep in silence dies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Around the hero's prostrate body flow'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In one promiscuous stream, the reeking blood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now a band of Argive monarchs brings</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The glorious victor to the king of kings.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From his dead friend the pensive warrior went,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With steps unwilling, to the regal tent.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The attending heralds, as by office bound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With kindled flames the tripod-vase surround:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To cleanse his conquering hands from hostile gore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">They urged in vain; the chief refused, and swore:<note place="foot"><p>—<hi rend="font-style: italic">And swore.</hi> Literally, and called Orcus, the god of
oaths, to witness. See Buttmann, Lexilog, p. 436.</p></note></l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">But great Pelides, stretch'd along the shore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where, dash'd on rocks, the broken billows roar,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lies inly groaning; while on either hand</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Along the grass his languid members fall,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">When lo! the shade, before his closing eyes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of sad Patroclus rose, or seem'd to rise:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In the same robe he living wore, he came:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In stature, voice, and pleasing look, the same.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The form familiar hover'd o'er his head,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"And sleeps Achilles? (thus the phantom said:)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sleeps my Achilles, his Patroclus dead?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Living, I seem'd his dearest, tenderest care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But now forgot, I wander in the air.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let my pale corse the rites of burial know,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And give me entrance in the realms below:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Till then the spirit finds no resting-place,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But here and there the unbodied spectres chase</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The vagrant dead around the dark abode,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Forbid to cross the irremeable flood.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now give thy hand; for to the farther shore</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When once we pass, the soul returns no more:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When once the last funereal flames ascend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No more shall meet Achilles and his friend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No more our thoughts to those we loved make known;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or quit the dearest, to converse alone.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Me fate has sever'd from the sons of earth,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fate fore-doom'd that waited from my birth:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thee too it waits; before the Trojan wall</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Even great and godlike thou art doom'd to fall.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Sperchius! whose waves in mazy errors lost</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Once more afresh the Grecian sorrows flow:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now the sun had set upon their woe;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But to the king of men thus spoke the chief:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">High on the top the manly corse they lay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And well-fed sheep and sable oxen slay:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles covered with their fat the dead,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Four sprightly coursers, with a deadly groan</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">To gentle Zephyr and the Boreal blast:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">All night Achilles hails Patroclus' soul,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">As a poor father, helpless and undone,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Mourns o'er the ashes of an only son,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Takes a sad pleasure the last bones to burn,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">So watch'd the flames, till now they flame no more.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Twas when, emerging through the shades of night.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The morning planet told the approach of light;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, fast behind, Aurora's warmer ray</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'er the broad ocean pour'd the golden day:</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then parting from the pile he ceased to weep,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of thronging Grecians round Achilles stood;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The tumult waked him: from his eyes he shook</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unwilling slumber, and the chiefs bespoke:</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Ye kings and princes of the Achaian name!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">First let us quench the yet remaining flame</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With sable wine; then, as the rites direct,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hero's bones with careful view select:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">These wrapp'd in double cauls of fat, prepare;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And in the golden vase dispose with care;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There let them rest with decent honour laid,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sacred relics to the tent they bore;</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The swarming populace the chief detains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And leads amidst a wide extent of plains;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There placed them round: then from the ships proceeds</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A train of oxen, mules, and stately steeds,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Vases and tripods (for the funeral games),</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Resplendent brass, and more resplendent dames.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">First stood the prizes to reward the force</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of rapid racers in the dusty course:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A woman for the first, in beauty's bloom,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Skill'd in the needle, and the labouring loom;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And a large vase, where two bright handles rise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of twenty measures its capacious size.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The second victor claims a mare unbroke,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Big with a mule, unknowing of the yoke:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The third, a charger yet untouch'd by flame;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Four ample measures held the shining frame:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Two golden talents for the fourth were placed:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">An ample double bowl contents the last.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These in fair order ranged upon the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hero, rising, thus address'd the train:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Behold the prizes, valiant Greeks! decreed</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To the brave rulers of the racing steed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prizes which none beside ourself could gain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Should our immortal coursers take the plain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(A race unrivall'd, which from ocean's god</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Peleus received, and on his son bestow'd.)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But this no time our vigour to display;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor suit, with them, the games of this sad day:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lost is Patroclus now, that wont to deck</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their flowing manes, and sleek their glossy neck.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sad, as they shared in human grief, they stand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And trail those graceful honours on the sand!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Let others for the noble task prepare,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fired at his word the rival racers rise;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But far the first Eumelus hopes the prize,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Base wealth preferring to eternal praise.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next him Antilochus demands the course</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With beating heart, and cheers his Pylian horse.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Experienced Nestor gives his son the reins,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor idly warns the hoary sire, nor hears</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"My son! though youthful ardour fire thy breast,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Compare those rivals' judgment and thy own:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">It is not strength, but art, obtains the prize,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus (nought unsaid) the much-advising sage</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">At once the coursers from the barrier bound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The lifted scourges all at once resound;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their heart, their eyes, their voice, they send before;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And up the champaign thunder from the shore:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thick, where they drive, the dusty clouds arise,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Loose on their shoulders the long manes reclined,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Float in their speed, and dance upon the wind:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The smoking chariots, rapid as they bound,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">First flew Eumelus on Pheretian steeds;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With those of Tros bold Diomed succeeds:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Close on Eumelus' back they puff the wind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And seem just mounting on his car behind;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Full on his neck he feels the sultry breeze,</l>

<pb n="416" /><anchor id="Pg416" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But angry Phoebus to Tydides flies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Strikes from his hand the scourge, and renders vain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His matchless horses' labour on the plain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rage fills his eye with anguish, to survey</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Snatch'd from his hope the glories of the day.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fraud celestial Pallas sees with pain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Springs to her knight, and gives the scourge again,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And fills his steeds with vigour. At a stroke</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She breaks his rival's chariot from the yoke:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No more their way the startled horses held;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The car reversed came rattling on the field;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shot headlong from his seat, beside the wheel,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prone on the dust the unhappy master fell;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His batter'd face and elbows strike the ground;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nose, mouth, and front, one undistinguish'd wound:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Grief stops his voice, a torrent drowns his eyes:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before him far the glad Tydides flies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Minerva's spirit drives his matchless pace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And crowns him victor of the labour'd race.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The next, though distant, Menelaus succeeds;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While thus young Nestor animates his steeds:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Now, now, my generous pair, exert your force;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not that we hope to match Tydides' horse,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Since great Minerva wings their rapid way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gives their lord the honours of the day;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But reach Atrides! shall his mare outgo</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Your swiftness? vanquish'd by a female foe?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through your neglect, if lagging on the plain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The last ignoble gift be all we gain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No more shall Nestor's hand your food supply,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The old man's fury rises, and ye die.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Haste then: yon narrow road, before our sight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Presents the occasion, could we use it right."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus he. The coursers at their master's threat</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With quicker steps the sounding champaign beat.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now Antilochus with nice survey</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Observes the compass of the hollow way.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Twas where, by force of wintry torrents torn,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fast by the road a precipice was worn:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Here, where but one could pass, to shun the throng</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Spartan hero's chariot smoked along.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Close up the venturous youth resolves to keep,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still edging near, and bears him toward the steep.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Atrides, trembling, casts his eye below,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And wonders at the rashness of his foe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Hold, stay your steeds—What madness thus to ride</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This narrow way! take larger field (he cried),</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or both must fall."—Atrides cried in vain;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He flies more fast, and throws up all the rein.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Far as an able arm the disk can send,</l>
<pb n="417" /><anchor id="Pg417" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When youthful rivals their full force extend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So far, Antilochus! thy chariot flew</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Before the king: he, cautious, backward drew</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His horse compell'd; foreboding in his fears</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rattling ruin of the clashing cars,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The floundering coursers rolling on the plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And conquest lost through frantic haste to gain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But thus upbraids his rival as he flies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Go, furious youth! ungenerous and unwise!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Go, but expect not I'll the prize resign;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Add perjury to fraud, and make it thine—"</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then to his steeds with all his force he cries,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Be swift, be vigorous, and regain the prize!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Your rivals, destitute of youthful force,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With fainting knees shall labour in the course,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And yield the glory yours."—The steeds obey;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Already at their heels they wing their way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And seem already to retrieve the day.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Meantime the Grecians in a ring beheld</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The coursers bounding o'er the dusty field.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The first who mark'd them was the Cretan king;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High on a rising ground, above the ring,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The monarch sat: from whence with sure survey</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He well observed the chief who led the way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And heard from far his animating cries,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And saw the foremost steed with sharpen'd eyes;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">On whose broad front a blaze of shining white,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like the full moon, stood obvious to the sight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He saw; and rising, to the Greeks begun:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Are yonder horse discern'd by me alone?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or can ye, all, another chief survey,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And other steeds than lately led the way?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Those, though the swiftest, by some god withheld,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lie sure disabled in the middle field:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For, since the goal they doubled, round the plain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I search to find them, but I search in vain.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Perchance the reins forsook the driver's hand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, turn'd too short, he tumbled on the strand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shot from the chariot; while his coursers stray</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With frantic fury from the destined way.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rise then some other, and inform my sight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For these dim eyes, perhaps, discern not right;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet sure he seems, to judge by shape and air,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The great Ætolian chief, renown'd in war."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Old man! (Oileus rashly thus replies)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy tongue too hastily confers the prize;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of those who view the course, nor sharpest eyed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor youngest, yet the readiest to decide.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Eumelus' steeds, high bounding in the chase,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still, as at first, unrivall'd lead the race:</l>
<pb n="418" /><anchor id="Pg418" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I well discern him, as he shakes the rein,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And hear his shouts victorious o'er the plain."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus he. Idomeneus, incensed, rejoin'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Barbarous of words! and arrogant of mind!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Contentious prince, of all the Greeks beside</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The last in merit, as the first in pride!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To vile reproach what answer can we make?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A goblet or a tripod let us stake,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And be the king the judge. The most unwise</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Will learn their rashness, when they pay the price."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said: and Ajax, by mad passion borne,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stern had replied; fierce scorn enhancing scorn</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To fell extremes. But Thetis' godlike son</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Awful amidst them rose, and thus begun:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Forbear, ye chiefs! reproachful to contend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Much would ye blame, should others thus offend:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And lo! the approaching steeds your contest end."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No sooner had he spoke, but thundering near,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Drives, through a stream of dust, the charioteer.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">High o'er his head the circling lash he wields:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His bounding horses scarcely touch the fields:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His car amidst the dusty whirlwind roll'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bright with the mingled blaze of tin and gold,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Refulgent through the cloud: no eye could find</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The track his flying wheels had left behind:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the fierce coursers urged their rapid pace</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So swift, it seem'd a flight, and not a race.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now victor at the goal Tydides stands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Quits his bright car, and springs upon the sands;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From the hot steeds the sweaty torrents stream;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The well-plied whip is hung athwart the beam:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With joy brave Sthenelus receives the prize,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The tripod-vase, and dame with radiant eyes:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These to the ships his train triumphant leads,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The chief himself unyokes the panting steeds.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Young Nestor follows (who by art, not force,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'erpass'd Atrides) second in the course.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behind, Atrides urged the race, more near</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Than to the courser in his swift career</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The following car, just touching with his heel</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And brushing with his tail the whirling wheel:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such, and so narrow now the space between</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The rivals, late so distant on the green;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So soon swift Æthe her lost ground regain'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One length, one moment, had the race obtain'd.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Merion pursued, at greater distance still,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With tardier coursers, and inferior skill.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Last came, Admetus! thy unhappy son;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Slow dragged the steeds his batter'd chariot on:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles saw, and pitying thus begun:</l>
</lg>

<pb n="419" /><anchor id="Pg419" />

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Behold! the man whose matchless art surpass'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sons of Greece! the ablest, yet the last!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fortune denies, but justice bids us pay</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(Since great Tydides bears the first away)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To him the second honours of the day."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The Greeks consent with loud-applauding cries,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And then Eumelus had received the prize,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But youthful Nestor, jealous of his fame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The award opposes, and asserts his claim.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Think not (he cries) I tamely will resign,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O Peleus' son! the mare so justly mine.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What if the gods, the skilful to confound,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Have thrown the horse and horseman to the ground?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Perhaps he sought not heaven by sacrifice,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And vows omitted forfeited the prize.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If yet (distinction to thy friend to show,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And please a soul desirous to bestow)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Some gift must grace Eumelus, view thy store</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of beauteous handmaids, steeds, and shining ore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">An ample present let him thence receive,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Greece shall praise thy generous thirst to give.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But this my prize I never shall forego;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">This, who but touches, warriors! is my foe."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus spake the youth; nor did his words offend;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pleased with the well-turn'd flattery of a friend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles smiled: "The gift proposed (he cried),</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Antilochus! we shall ourself provide.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With plates of brass the corslet cover'd o'er,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The same renown'd Asteropaeus wore,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whose glittering margins raised with silver shine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(No vulgar gift,) Eumelus! shall be thine."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said: Automedon at his command</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The corslet brought, and gave it to his hand.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Distinguish'd by his friend, his bosom glows</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With generous joy: then Menelaus rose;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The herald placed the sceptre in his hands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And still'd the clamour of the shouting bands.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not without cause incensed at Nestor's son,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And inly grieving, thus the king begun:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"The praise of wisdom, in thy youth obtain'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">An act so rash, Antilochus! has stain'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Robb'd of my glory and my just reward,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To you, O Grecians! be my wrong declared:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So not a leader shall our conduct blame,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or judge me envious of a rival's fame.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But shall not we, ourselves, the truth maintain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What needs appealing in a fact so plain?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What Greek shall blame me, if I bid thee rise,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And vindicate by oath th' ill-gotten prize?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rise if thou darest, before thy chariot stand,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The driving scourge high-lifted in thy hand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And touch thy steeds, and swear thy whole intent</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Was but to conquer, not to circumvent.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swear by that god whose liquid arms surround</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The globe, and whose dread earthquakes heave the ground!"</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The prudent chief with calm attention heard;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then mildly thus: "Excuse, if youth have err'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Superior as thou art, forgive the offence,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor I thy equal, or in years, or sense.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thou know'st the errors of unripen'd age,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Weak are its counsels, headlong is its rage.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The prize I quit, if thou thy wrath resign;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The mare, or aught thou ask'st, be freely thine</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ere I become (from thy dear friendship torn)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Hateful to thee, and to the gods forsworn."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">So spoke Antilochus; and at the word</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The mare contested to the king restored.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Joy swells his soul: as when the vernal grain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Lifts the green ear above the springing plain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fields their vegetable life renew,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And laugh and glitter with the morning dew;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such joy the Spartan's shining face o'erspread,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And lifted his gay heart, while thus he said:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Still may our souls, O generous youth! agree</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">'Tis now Atrides' turn to yield to thee.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rash heat perhaps a moment might control,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not break, the settled temper of thy soul.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not but (my friend) 'tis still the wiser way</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To waive contention with superior sway;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For ah! how few, who should like thee offend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like thee, have talents to regain the friend!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To plead indulgence, and thy fault atone,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Suffice thy father's merit and thy own:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Generous alike, for me, the sire and son</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Have greatly suffer'd, and have greatly done.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I yield; that all may know, my soul can bend,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor is my pride preferr'd before my friend."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said; and pleased his passion to command,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Resign'd the courser to Noemon's hand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Friend of the youthful chief: himself content,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The shining charger to his vessel sent.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The golden talents Merion next obtain'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The fifth reward, the double bowl, remain'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles this to reverend Nestor bears.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thus the purpose of his gift declares:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Accept thou this, O sacred sire! (he said)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In dear memorial of Patroclus dead;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Dead and for ever lost Patroclus lies,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">But left the glory of the past thy own."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said, and placed the goblet at his side;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With joy the venerable king replied:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Wisely and well, my son, thy words have proved</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A senior honour'd, and a friend beloved!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Too true it is, deserted of my strength,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">These wither'd arms and limbs have fail'd at length.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oh! had I now that force I felt of yore,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Surpass'd Iphyclus in the swift career,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Phyleus and Polydorus with the spear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sons of Actor won the prize of horse,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But won by numbers, not by art or force:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Prize after prize by Nestor borne away,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sprung to their car; and with united pains</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">One lash'd the coursers, while one ruled the reins.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Such once I was! Now to these tasks succeeds</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A younger race, that emulate our deeds:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">I yield, alas! (to age who must not yield?)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Though once the foremost hero of the field.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Go thou, my son! by generous friendship led,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With martial honours decorate the dead:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While pleased I take the gift thy hands present,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Proud of the gift, thus spake the full of days:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The prizes next are order'd to the field,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">This dreadful combat great Epeus chose;<note place="foot"><p>Virgil, by making the boaster vanquished, has drawn a better

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"The haughty Dares in the lists appears:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Walking he strides, his head erected bears:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His nervous arms the weighty gauntlet wield,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">His brawny breast and ample chest he shows;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His lifted arms around his head he throws,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">His match is sought, but, through the trembling band,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">No one dares answer to the proud demand.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Presuming of his force, with sparkling eyes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Already he devours the promised prize.</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The third bold game Achilles next demands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And calls the wrestlers to the level sands:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A massy tripod for the victor lies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of twice six oxen its reputed price;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And next, the loser's spirits to restore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A female captive, valued but at four.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Scarce did the chief the vigorous strife prop</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When tower-like Ajax and Ulysses rose.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Amid the ring each nervous rival stands,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Embracing rigid with implicit hands.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Close lock'd above, their heads and arms are mix'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Below, their planted feet at distance fix'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Like two strong rafters which the builder forms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Proof to the wintry winds and howling storms,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their tops connected, but at wider space</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fix'd on the centre stands their solid base.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now to the grasp each manly body bends;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The humid sweat from every pore descends;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their bones resound with blows: sides, shoulders, thighs</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor could Ulysses, for his art renown'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">O'erturn the strength of Ajax on the ground;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor could the strength of Ajax overthrow</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The watchful caution of his artful foe.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While the long strife even tired the lookers on,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus to Ulysses spoke great Telamon:</l>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He said; and, straining, heaved him off the ground</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With matchless strength; that time Ulysses found</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The strength to evade, and where the nerves combine</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His ankle struck: the giant fell supine;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ulysses, following, on his bosom lies;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shouts of applause run rattling through the skies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ajax to lift Ulysses next essays;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He barely stirr'd him, but he could not raise:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">And grappling close, they tumbled side by side.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Defiled with honourable dust they roll,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still breathing strife, and unsubdued of soul:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Again they rage, again to combat rise;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">When great Achilles thus divides the prize:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hero's words the willing chiefs obey,</l>

</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now succeed the gifts ordain'd to grace</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The youths contending in the rapid race:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A silver urn that full six measures held,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By none in weight or workmanship excell'd:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Sidonian artists taught the frame to shine,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Elaborate, with artifice divine;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whence Tyrian sailors did the prize transport,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And gave to Thoas at the Lemnian port:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">From him descended, good Eunaeus heir'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The glorious gift; and, for Lycaon spared,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To brave Patroclus gave the rich reward:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now, the same hero's funeral rites to grace,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">It stands the prize of swiftness in the race.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A well-fed ox was for the second placed;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And half a talent must content the last.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles rising then bespoke the train:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Who hope the palm of swiftness to obtain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Stand forth, and bear these prizes from the plain."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The hero said, and starting from his place,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Oilean Ajax rises to the race;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ulysses next; and he whose speed surpass'd</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His youthful equals, Nestor's son, the last.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ranged in a line the ready racers stand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Pelides points the barrier with his hand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All start at once; Oileus led the race;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The next Ulysses, measuring pace with pace;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behind him, diligently close, he sped,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">As closely following as the running thread</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The spindle follows, and displays the charms</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of the fair spinster's breast and moving arms:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Graceful in motion thus, his foe he plies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And treads each footstep ere the dust can rise;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His glowing breath upon his shoulders plays:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The admiring Greeks loud acclamations raise:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To him they give their wishes, hearts, and eyes,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And send their souls before him as he flies.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now three times turn'd in prospect of the goal,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The panting chief to Pallas lifts his soul:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Assist, O goddess!" thus in thought he pray'd!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And present at his thought descends the maid.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Buoy'd by her heavenly force, he seems to swim,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And feels a pinion lifting every limb.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All fierce, and ready now the prize to gain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Unhappy Ajax stumbles on the plain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(O'erturn'd by Pallas), where the slippery shore</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Was clogg'd with slimy dung and mingled gore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(The self-same place beside Patroclus' pyre,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Where late the slaughter'd victims fed the fire.)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Besmear'd with filth, and blotted o'er with clay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Obscene to sight, the rueful racer lay;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The well-fed bull (the second prize) he shared,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And left the urn Ulysses' rich reward.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then, grasping by the horn the mighty beast,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The baffled hero thus the Greeks address'd:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Accursed fate! the conquest I forego;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A mortal I, a goddess was my foe;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">She urged her favourite on the rapid way,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And Pallas, not Ulysses, won the day."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thus sourly wail'd he, sputtering dirt and gore;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A burst of laughter echoed through the shore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Antilochus, more humorous than the rest,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Takes the last prize, and takes it with a jest:</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Why with our wiser elders should we strive?</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The gods still love them, and they always thrive.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Ye see, to Ajax I must yield the prize:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">He to Ulysses, still more aged and wise;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(A green old age unconscious of decays,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That proves the hero born in better days!)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Behold his vigour in this active race!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Achilles only boasts a swifter pace:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For who can match Achilles? He who can,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Must yet be more than hero, more than man."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The effect succeeds the speech. Pelides cries,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Thy artful praise deserves a better prize.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor Greece in vain shall hear thy friend extoll'd;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Receive a talent of the purest gold."</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The youth departs content. The host admire</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The son of Nestor, worthy of his sire.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Next these a buckler, spear, and helm, he brings;</l>
<pb n="426" /><anchor id="Pg426" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Cast on the plain, the brazen burden rings:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Arms which of late divine Sarpedon wore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And great Patroclus in short triumph bore.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Stand forth the bravest of our host! (he cries)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Whoever dares deserve so rich a prize,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now grace the lists before our army's sight,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And sheathed in steel, provoke his foe to fight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who first the jointed armour shall explore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And stain his rival's mail with issuing gore,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The sword Asteropaeus possess'd of old,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">(A Thracian blade, distinct with studs of gold,)</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shall pay the stroke, and grace the striker's side:</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">For each brave champion, when the combat ends,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A sumptuous banquet at our tents attends."</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fierce at the word uprose great Tydeus' son,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And the huge bulk of Ajax Telamon.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Clad in refulgent steel, on either hand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The dreadful chiefs amid the circle stand;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Louring they meet, tremendous to the sight;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Each Argive bosom beats with fierce delight.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Opposed in arms not long they idly stood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But thrice they closed, and thrice the charge renew'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A furious pass the spear of Ajax made</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Through the broad shield, but at the corslet stay'd.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not thus the foe: his javelin aim'd above</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The buckler's margin, at the neck he drove.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Greece, now trembling for her hero's life,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Bade share the honours, and surcease the strife.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet still the victor's due Tydides gains,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">With him the sword and studded belt remains.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then hurl'd the hero, thundering on the ground,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A mass of iron (an enormous round),</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Rude from the furnace, and but shaped by fire.</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Among his spoils this memorable load.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For this, he bids those nervous artists vie,</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">"Let him, whose might can hurl this bowl, arise;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who farthest hurls it, take it as his prize;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If he be one enrich'd with large domain</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Of downs for flocks, and arable for grain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Small stock of iron needs that man provide;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His hinds and swains whole years shall be supplied</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Swift from the string the sounding arrow flies;</l>

<p>ARGUMENT.</p>

<p>THE REDEMPTION OF THE BODY OF HECTOR.</p>

<p>The gods deliberate about the redemption of Hector's body. Jupiter
sends Thetis to Achilles, to dispose him for the restoring it, and Iris
to Priam, to encourage him to go in person and treat for it. The old
king, notwithstanding the remonstrances of his queen, makes ready for
the journey, to which he is encouraged by an omen from Jupiter. He sets
forth in his chariot, with a waggon loaded with presents, under the
charge of Idaeus the herald. Mercury descends in the shape of a young
man, and conducts him to the pavilion of Achilles. Their conversation
on the way. Priam finds Achilles at his table, casts himself at his
feet, and begs for the body of his son: Achilles, moved with
compassion, grants his request, detains him one night in his tent, and
the next morning sends him home with the body: the Trojans run out to
meet him. The lamentations of Andromache, Hecuba, and Helen, with the
solemnities of the funeral.</p>

<p>The time of twelve days is employed in this book, while the body of
Hector lies in the tent of Achilles; and as many more are spent in the
truce allowed for his interment. The scene is partly in Achilles' camp,
and partly in Troy.</p>

<lg>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now from the finish'd games the Grecian band</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Seek their black ships, and clear the crowded strand,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All stretch'd at ease the genial banquet share,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And pleasing slumbers quiet all their care.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Not so Achilles: he, to grief resign'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">His friend's dear image present to his mind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Takes his sad couch, more unobserved to weep;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Nor tastes the gifts of all-composing sleep.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Restless he roll'd around his weary bed,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And all his soul on his Patroclus fed:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The form so pleasing, and the heart so kind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That youthful vigour, and that manly mind,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What toils they shared, what martial works they wrought,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What seas they measured, and what fields they fought;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All pass'd before him in remembrance dear,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thought follows thought, and tear succeeds to tear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And now supine, now prone, the hero lay,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Now shifts his side, impatient for the day:</l>
<pb n="430" /><anchor id="Pg430" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Then starting up, disconsolate he goes</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Wide on the lonely beach to vent his woes.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There as the solitary mourner raves,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The ruddy morning rises o'er the waves:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Soon as it rose, his furious steeds he join'd!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The chariot flies, and Hector trails behind.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And thrice, Patroclus! round thy monument</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Was Hector dragg'd, then hurried to the tent.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">There sleep at last o'ercomes the hero's eyes;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">While foul in dust the unhonour'd carcase lies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But not deserted by the pitying skies:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">For Phoebus watch'd it with superior care,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Preserved from gaping wounds and tainting air;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And, ignominious as it swept the field,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Spread o'er the sacred corse his golden shield.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">All heaven was moved, and Hermes will'd to go</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">By stealth to snatch him from the insulting foe:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But Neptune this, and Pallas this denies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">And th' unrelenting empress of the skies,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">E'er since that day implacable to Troy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">What time young Paris, simple shepherd boy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Won by destructive lust (reward obscene),</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Their charms rejected for the Cyprian queen.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But when the tenth celestial morning broke,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To heaven assembled, thus Apollo spoke:</l>

<pb n="431" /><anchor id="Pg431" />
<l rend="margin-left: 2">That iron heart, inflexibly severe;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">A lion, not a man, who slaughters wide,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">In strength of rage, and impotence of pride;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Who hastes to murder with a savage joy,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Invades around, and breathes but to destroy!</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Shame is not of his soul; nor understood,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">The greatest evil and the greatest good.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Still for one loss he rages unresign'd,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Repugnant to the lot of all mankind;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">To lose a friend, a brother, or a son,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Heaven dooms each mortal, and its will is done:</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Awhile they sorrow, then dismiss their care;</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Fate gives the wound, and man is born to bear.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">But this insatiate, the commission given</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">But mine, and every god's peculiar grace</l>

Coleridge are well worth reading:—</p>

<p>"By a close study of life, and by a true and natural mode of expressing
everything, Homer was enabled to venture upon the most peculiar and
difficult situations, and to extricate himself from them with the
completest success. The whole scene between Achilles and Priam, when
the latter comes to the Greek camp for the purpose of redeeming the
body of Hector, is at once the most profoundly skilful, and yet the
simplest and most affecting passage in the Iliad. Quinctilian has taken
notice of the following speech of Priam, the rhetorical artifice of
which is so transcendent, that if genius did not often, especially in
oratory, unconsciously fulfil the most subtle precepts of criticism, we
might be induced, on this account alone, to consider the last book of
the Iliad as what is called spurious, in other words, of later date
than the rest of the poem. Observe the exquisite taste of Priam in
occupying the mind of Achilles, from the outset, with the image of his
father; in gradually introducing the parallel of his own situation;
and, lastly, mentioning Hector's name when he perceives that the hero
is softened, and then only in such a manner as to flatter the pride of
the conqueror. The ego d'eleeinoteros per, and the apusato aecha
geronta, are not exactly like the tone of the earlier parts of the
Iliad. They are almost too fine and pathetic. The whole passage defies
translation, for there is that about the Greek which has no name, but
which is of so fine and ethereal a subtlety that it can only be felt in
the original, and is lost in an attempt to transfuse it into another
language."—Coleridge, p. 195.</p></note></l>

cannot but offend as referred to the modern standard of humanity. The
heroic age, however, must be judged by its own moral laws. Retributive
vengeance on the dead, as well as the living, was a duty inculcated
by the religion of those barbarous times which not only taught that
evil inflicted on the author of evil was a solace to the injured man;
but made the welfare of the soul after death dependent on the fate of
the body from which it had separated. Hence a denial of the rites
essential to the soul's admission into the more favoured regions of the
lower world was a cruel punishment to the wanderer on the dreary shores
of the infernal river. The complaint of the ghost of Patroclus to
Achilles, of but a brief postponement of his own obsequies, shows how
efficacious their refusal to the remains of his destroyer must have
been in satiating the thirst of revenge, which, even after death, was
supposed to torment the dwellers in Hades. Hence before yielding up the
body of Hector to Priam, Achilles asks pardon of Patroclus for even
this partial cession of his just rights of retribution."—Mure, vol. i.

gallant and interesting view of Helen's character—</p>

<p>"Few things are more interesting than to observe how the same hand that
has given us the fury and inconsistency of Achilles, gives us also the
consummate elegance and tenderness of Helen. She is through the Iliad a
genuine lady, graceful in motion and speech, noble in her associations,
full of remorse for a fault for which higher powers seem responsible,
yet grateful and affectionate towards those with whom that fault had
committed her. I have always thought the following speech in which
Helen laments Hector, and hints at her own invidious and unprotected
situation in Troy, as almost the sweetest passage in the poem. It is
another striking instance of that refinement of feeling and softness of
tone which so generally distinguish the last book of the Iliad from the
rest."—Classic Poets, p. 198, seq.</p></note></l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Yet was it ne'er my fate, from thee to find</l>

<l rend="margin-left: 2">Thy pity check'd my sorrows in their flow.</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">If some proud brother eyed me with disdain,</l>
<l rend="margin-left: 2">Or scornful sister with her sweeping train,</l>

the full influence of the more amiable affections, while our admiration
of his great qualities is chastened by the reflection that, within a
few short days the mighty being in whom they were united was himself to
be suddenly cut off in the full vigour of their exercise.</p>

<p>The frequent and touching allusions, interspersed throughout the Iliad,
to the speedy termination of its hero's course, and the moral on the
vanity of human life which they indicate, are among the finest
evidences of the spirit of ethic unity by which the whole framework of

<head>CONCLUDING NOTE.</head>

<p>We have now passed through the Iliad, and seen the anger of Achilles,
and the terrible effects of it, at an end, as that only was the subject
of the poem, and the nature of epic poetry would not permit our author
to proceed to the event of the war, it perhaps may be acceptable to the
common reader to give a short account of what happened to Troy and the
chief actors in this poem after the conclusion of it.</p>

<p>I need not mention that Troy was taken soon after the death of Hector
by the stratagem of the wooden horse, the particulars of which are
described by Virgil in the second book of the Æneid.</p>

<p>Achilles fell before Troy, by the hand of Paris, by the shot of an
arrow in his heel, as Hector had prophesied at his death, lib. xxii.</p>

<p>The unfortunate Priam was killed by Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles.</p>

<p>Ajax, after the death of Achilles, had a contest with Ulysses for the
armour of Vulcan, but being defeated in his aim, he slew himself
through indignation.</p>

<p>Helen, after the death of Paris, married Deiphobus his brother, and at
the taking of Troy betrayed him, in order to reconcile herself to
Menelaus her first husband, who received her again into favour.</p>

<p>Agamemnon at his return was barbarously murdered by Ægysthus, at the
instigation of Clytemnestra his wife, who in his absence had
dishonoured his bed with Ægysthus.</p>

<p>Diomed, after the fall of Troy, was expelled his own country, and
scarce escaped with his life from his adulterous wife Ægiale; but at
last was received by Daunus in Apulia, and shared his kingdom; it is
uncertain how he died.</p>

<p>Nestor lived in peace with his children, in Pylos, his native country.</p>

<p>Ulysses also, after innumerable troubles by sea and land, at last
returned in safety to Ithaca, which is the subject of Homer's Odyssey.</p>

<p>For what remains, I beg to be excused from the ceremonies of taking
leave at the end of my work, and from embarrassing myself, or others,
with any defences or apologies about it. But instead of endeavouring to
raise a vain monument to myself, of the merits or difficulties of it
(which must be left to the world, to truth, and to posterity), let me
leave behind me a memorial of my friendship with one of the most
valuable of men, as well as finest writers, of my age and country, one
who has tried, and knows by his own experience, how hard an undertaking
it is to do justice to Homer, and one whom (I am sure) sincerely
rejoices with me at the period of my labours. To him, therefore, having
brought this long work to a conclusion, I desire to dedicate it, and to
have the honour and satisfaction of placing together, in this manner,
the names of Mr. CONGREVE, and of</p>

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the Foundation” or
PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States. If an individual
work is in the public domain in the United States and you are located in
the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying,
distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative works based on
the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of
course, we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of
promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project
Gutenberg™ works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for
keeping the Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can
easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when you
share it without charge with others.

included with the permission of the copyright holder. Information on the
copyright owner for this particular work and the terms of use imposed by
the copyright holder on this work are set forth at the beginning of this
work.


1.D.

can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant
state of change. If you are outside the United States, check the laws of
your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before
downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or creating

1.F.


1.F.1.


Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to
identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread public domain
works in creating the Project Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these
efforts, Project Gutenberg™ electronic works, and the medium on which they
may be stored, may contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to,
incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright
or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk
or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot
be read by your equipment.


1.F.2.


LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES — Except for the “Right of
Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg™
trademark, and any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg™
electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for
damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE
NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH
OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3. YOU AGREE THAT THE
FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL,
PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY
OF SUCH DAMAGE.


1.F.3.


LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND — If you discover a defect in this
electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund
of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to
the person you received the work from. If you received the work on a
physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation.
The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect
to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund. If you received the
work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose
to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in
lieu of a refund. If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a
refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.


1.F.4.


Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in

Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the
exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or
limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state
applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make
the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state
law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement
shall not void the remaining provisions.


1.F.6.


INDEMNITY — You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the trademark
owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone providing copies of
Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and

and expenses, including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from
any of the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of
this or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any Defect
you cause.


Section  2.


           Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™


Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic
works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including
obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the
efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks
of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance
they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring
that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for
generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for
Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations
can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation web page at
http://www.pglaf.org.

  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
                                Foundation


Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed
in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment
including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are
particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.
Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable
effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these
requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not
received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or
determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have
not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against
accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us
with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the
United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods
and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including
checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please
visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.


      General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works.


Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg™
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with
anyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™
eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions,
all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright
notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance
with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook’s eBook
number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed
(zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the
old filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.
_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:


    http://www.gutenberg.org


This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how
to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,
how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email
newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
